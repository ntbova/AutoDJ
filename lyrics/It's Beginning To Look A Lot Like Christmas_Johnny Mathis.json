{"song": "It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas", "artist": "Johnny Mathis", "lyrics": "\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\nEv'rywhere you go;\nTake a look in the five and ten glistening once again\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\nToys in ev'ry store\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\nOn your own front door\n\nA pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben;\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen;\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\nEv'rywhere you go;\nThere's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well\nThe sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\nSoon the bells will start\nAnd the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\nRight within your heart\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)\nChristmas (Christmas, Christmas)\n\n"}
