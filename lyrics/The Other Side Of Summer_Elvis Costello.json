{"song": "The Other Side Of Summer", "artist": "Elvis Costello", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe sun struggles up another beautiful day\nAnd I felt glad in my own suspicious way\nDespite the contradiction and confusion\nFelt tragic without reason\nThere's malice and there's magic in every season\n\n[Chorus]\nFrom the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf\nThe other side of Summer\nTo the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf\nThe other side of Summer\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe automatic gates close up between the shanties and the palace\nThe blowtorch amusements, the voodoo chalice\nThe pale pathetic promises that everybody swallows\nA teenage girl is crying because she don't look like a million dollars\nSo help her if you can\nBecause she don't seem to have the attention span\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWas it a millionaire who said \"imagine no possessions\"?\nA poor little schoolboy who said \"we don't need no lessons\"?\nThe rabid rebel dogs ransack the shampoo shop\nThe pop princess is downtown shooting up\nAnd if that goddess if fit for burning\nThe sun will struggle up the world will still keep turning\nMadman standing by the side of the road saying\n\"Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, look at my eyes, look at my eyes\"\nNow you can't afford to fake all the drugs your parents used to take\nBecause of their mistakes you'd better be wide awake\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe mightiest rose\nThe absence of perfume\nThe casual killers\nThe military curfew\nThe cardboard city\nAn unwanted birthday\nThe other side of summer\nThe dancing was desperate, the music was worse\nThey bury your dreams and dig up the worthless\nGoodnight\nGod bless\nAnd kiss \"goodbye\" to the earth\nThe other side of summer\n\n[Outro][x7]\nThe other side of the summer\n\n"}
