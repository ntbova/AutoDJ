There ain't nobody better\nOh, baby baby, we belong together\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind\nBobby Womack's on the radio\nSaying to me, \"If you think you're lonely now\"\nWait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)\nI gotta change the station\nSo I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break\nAnd then I hear Babyface\n\"I only think of you\"\nAnd it's breaking my heart\nI'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI'm feeling all out of my element\nThrowing things, cryin' tryin'\nTo figure out where the hell I went wrong\nThe pain reflected in this song\nAin't even half of what I'm feeling inside\nI need you, need you back in my life, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back, baby, please\n\u2018Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?\nWho\u2019s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?\nWho\u2019s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better\nOh, baby baby, we belong together\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, when you left, I lost a part of me\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back, baby, please\n\u2018Cause we belong together\nWho am I gonna lean on when times get rough?\nWho\u2019s gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?\nWho\u2019s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better\nOh, baby baby, we belong together\n\n"}
