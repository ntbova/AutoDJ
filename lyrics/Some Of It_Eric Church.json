{"song": "Some Of It", "artist": "Eric Church", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nBeer don't keep\nA glove's not cheap\nAnd trucks don't wreck themselves\nMama ain't a shrink\nDaddy ain't a bank\nAnd God ain't wishin' well\nMoney ain't rich\nEverybody sins\nAnd nobody wins in a fight\nAnd sometimes wrong is right\n\n[Chorus]\nSome of it you learn the hard way\nSome of it you read on a page\nSome of it comes from heartbreak\nMost of it comes with age\nAnd none of it ever comes easy\nA bunch of it you maybe can't use\nI know I don't probably know what I think or do\nBut there's something to some of it\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirls like to laugh\nTears don't last\nAnd scared's what praying's for\nIf it's close, swing the bat\nEverybody's gotta pass\nAnd love's worth living for\nWhen you dance, hold her close\n'Til it breaks, go for broke\nBe the first to reach for her hand\nNo, you don't get to do some things again\n\n[Chorus]\nSome of it you learn the hard way\nSome of it you read on a page\nSome of it comes from heartbreak\nMost of it comes with age\nAnd none of it ever comes easy\nA bunch of it you maybe can't use\nI know I don't probably know what I think or do\nBut there's something to some of it\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen you can't take it slow\n'Cause time sure won't\nWhat really makes you a man\nIs being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand\n\n[Chorus]\nSome of it you learn the hard way\nSome of it you read on a page\nSome of it comes from heartbreak\nMost of it comes with age\nAnd none of it ever comes easy\nA bunch of it you maybe can't use\nI know I don't probably know what I think or do\nBut there's something to some of it\nSome of it\n\n"}
