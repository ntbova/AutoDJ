{"song": "There Goes My Everything", "artist": "Jack Greene", "lyrics": "\n\nThere goes my only possesion there goes my everything\nI hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor\nAnd a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more\nThere goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams\nThere goes my only possesion there goes my everything\n\nAs my mem'ry turns back the pages I can see the happy years we had before\nNow the love that kept this old heart beating\nHas been shattered by the closing of a door\nThere goes my reason for living...\n\n"}
