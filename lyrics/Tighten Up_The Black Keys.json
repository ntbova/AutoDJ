Yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake my badge but my heart remains\nLovin' you, baby child\nTighten up on your reins\nYou are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true\n\n[Verse 3]\nSick for days in so many ways\nI'm achin' now, I'm achin' now\nIt's times like these I need relief\nPlease show me how, oh show me how to get right\nYeah, it's out of sight\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhen I was young and movin' fast\nNothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down\nNow I let the others pass, I've come around\nOh come around, 'cause I've found\n\n[Outro / Bridge]\nLivin' just to keep goin'\nGoin' just to be sane\nAll the while not knowin'\nIt's such a shame\n\nI don't need to get steady\nI know just how I feel\nI'm tellin' you to be ready\nMy dear\n\n"}
