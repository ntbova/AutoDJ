Hey. Hey. She's as mean as mean\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as black as black\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as mean as mean\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as black as black\nHey. Hey. Hey. I got to get her back\nHey. Hey. Hey. I got to get her back\nHey. Hey. Hey. I got to get her back\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as mean as mean\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as sick as sick\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as cool as cool\nHey. Hey. Hey. She's as black as black\n\n"}
