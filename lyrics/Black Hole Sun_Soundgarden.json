{"song": "Black Hole Sun", "artist": "Soundgarden", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn my eyes, indisposed\nIn disguises no one knows\nHides the face, lies the snake\nThe sun in my disgrace\nBoiling heat, summer stench\n'Neath the black the sky looks dead\nCall my name through the cream\nAnd I'll hear you scream again\n\n[Chorus]\nBlack hole sun, won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come? Won't you come?\n\n[Verse 2]\nStuttering, cold and damp\nSteal the warm wind tired friend\nTimes are gone for honest men\nAnd sometimes far too long for snakes\nIn my shoes, a walking sleep\nAnd my youth I pray to keep\nHeaven send Hell away\nNo one sings like you anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nBlack hole sun,  won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun,  won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHang my head, drown my fear\nTill you all just disappear\n\n[Chorus]\nBlack hole sun,  won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun,  won't you come\nAnd wash away the rain?\nBlack hole sun, won't you come?\nWon't you come?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nBlack hole sun, black hole sun\nWon't you come?\nWon't you come?\n\n"}
