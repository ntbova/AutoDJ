{"song": "Where Are You Christmas?", "artist": "Faith Hill", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse]\nWhere are you Christmas\nWhy can't I find you\nWhy have you gone away\nWhere is the laughter\nYou used to bring me\nWhy can't I hear music play\nMy world is changing\nI'm rearranging\nDoes that mean Christmas changes too\n\nWhere are you Christmas\nDo you remember\nThe one you used to know\nI'm not the same one\nSee what the time's done\nIs that why you have let me go\nChristmas is here\nEverywhere, oh\nChristmas is here\nIf you care, oh\nIf there is love in your heart and your mind\nYou will feel like Christmas all the time\n\nI feel you Christmas\nI know I've found you\nYou never fade away\nThe joy of Christmas\nStays here inside us\nFills each and every heart with love\n\n[Outro]\nWhere are you Christmas\nFill your heart with love\n\n"}
