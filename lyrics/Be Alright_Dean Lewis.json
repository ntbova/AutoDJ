{"song": "Be Alright", "artist": "Dean Lewis", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI look up from the ground\nTo see your sad and teary eyes\nYou look away from me\nAnd I see there's something you're trying to hide\nAnd I reach for your hand but it's cold\nYou pull away again\nAnd I wonder what's on your mind\nAnd then you say to me you made a dumb mistake\nYou start to tremble and your voice begins to break\nYou say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's\nThey were my mate's\nAnd I feel the colour draining from my face\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd my friend said\n\"I know you love her, but it's over, mate\nIt doesn't matter, put the phone away\nIt's never easy to walk away, let her go\nIt'll be alright\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I still look back at all the messages you'd sent\nAnd I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head\nAnd everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone\nAnd when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on\nBut it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday\nIt's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake\nAnd everything I know tells me that I should walk away\nBut I just want to stay\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd my friend said\n\"I know you love her, but it's over, mate\nIt doesn't matter, put the phone away\nIt's never easy to walk away, let her go\nIt'll be okay\nIt's gonna hurt for a bit of time\nSo bottoms up, let's forget tonight\nYou'll find another and you'll be just fine\nLet her go\"\n\n[Bridge]\nBut nothing heals the past like time\nAnd they can't steal\nThe love you're born to find\nBut nothing heals the past like time\nAnd they can't steal\nThe love you're born to find\n\n[Chorus]\n\"I know you love her, but it's over, mate\nIt doesn't matter, put the phone away\nIt's never easy to walk away, let her go\nIt'll be okay\nIt's gonna hurt for a bit of time\nSo bottoms up, let's forget tonight\nYou'll find another and you'll be just fine\nLet her go\"\n\n[Outro]\nIt'll be alright\nIt'll be alright\nIt'll be alright\nIt'll be alright\nIt'll be alright\n\n"}
