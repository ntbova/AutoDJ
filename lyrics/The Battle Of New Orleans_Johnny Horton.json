{"song": "The Battle Of New Orleans", "artist": "Johnny Horton", "lyrics": "\n\nIn 1814 we took a little trip\nAlong with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip\nWe took a little bacon and we took a little beans\nAnd we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans\n\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they begin to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n(One-two-three, with a-one-two-three)\n\nWe looked down a river\n(Hut-two)\nAnd we see'd the British come\n(Three-four)\nAnd there must have been a hundred of'em\n(Hut-two)\nBeatin' on the drums\n(Three-four)\nThey stepped so high\n(Hut-two)\nAnd they made their bugles ring\n(Three-four)\nWe stood beside our cotton bales\n(Hut-two)\nAnd didn't say a thing\n(Two-three-four)\n\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they begin to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nOld Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise\n(One-hut, two-three-four)\nIf we didn't fire our muskets\n(One-hut, two-three-four)\n'Till we looked 'em in the eye\n(One-hut, two-three-four)\nWe held our fire\n(Hut, two-three-four)\n'Till we see'd their faces well\nThen we opened up our squirrel guns\nAnd really gave 'em - well we\n\nFired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they begin to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nYeah, they ran through the briars\n(One-hup-two)\nAnd they ran through the brambles\n(Hup-two-three-four)\nAnd they ran through the bushes\n(Hup-two)\nWhere the rabbit couldn't go\n(Hup-two-three-four)\nThey ran so fast\n(Hup-two)\nThat the hounds couldn't catch 'em\n(One-two-three-four)\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n(One-two, hup-two-three-four)\n\nWe fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down\nSo we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round\nWe filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind\nAnd when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind\n\nWe fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'\nThere wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago\nWe fired once more and they begin to runnin'\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nYeah, they ran through the briars\n(Hup-one-two)\nAnd they ran through the brambles\n(One-two-three-four)\nAnd they ran through the bushes\n(Hup-two)\nWhere the rabbit couldn't go\n(Hup-two-three-four)\nThey ran so fast\n(Hup-two)\nThat the hounds couldn't catch 'em\n(One-two-three-four)\nOn down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico\n\nSongwriter:  Jimmy Driftwood\n\n"}
