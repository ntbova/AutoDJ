{"song": "Walkin' On The Sun", "artist": "Smash Mouth", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke\nAnd teach the world to sing in perfect harmony\nAnd teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars\nHey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe\nThis is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back\nIt's just like any fad, it retracts before impact\nAnd just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip\nIf you got the goods they'll come and buy it\nJust to stay in the clique\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't delay, act now, supplies are running out\nAllow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive\nAnd if you follow, there may be a tomorrow\nBut if the offer's shunned\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\n\n[Verse 2]\nTwenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out\nOf recession and oppression and together they toked\nAnd they folked out with guitars around a bonfire\nJust singing and clapping, man, what the hell happened?\nThen some were spellbound some were hell-bound\nSome they fell down and some got back up and\nFought back against the melt down\nAnd their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites\nBecause fashion is smashing the true meaning of it\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't delay, act now, supplies are running out\nAllow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive\nAnd if you follow, there may be a tomorrow\nBut if the offer's shunned\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked\nWith her tears because her baby's life has been revoked\nThe bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up\nMr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus\nSo don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked\nNews at ten, your neighborhood is under attack\nPut away the crack before the crack puts you away\nYou need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't delay, act now, supplies are running out\nAllow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive\nAnd if you follow, there may be a tomorrow\nBut if the offer's shunned\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\n\n[Outro]\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\nYou might as well be walking on the sun\n\n"}
