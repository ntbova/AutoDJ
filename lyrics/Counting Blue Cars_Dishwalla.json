{"song": "Counting Blue Cars", "artist": "Dishwalla", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nMust have been mid afternoon\nI could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out\nAnd he walked with a purpose in his sneakers down the street\nHe had many questions like children often do\n\n[Chorus]\nHe said, tell me all your thoughts on God\nTell me am I very far?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMust have been late afternoon\nOn our way the sun broke free of the clouds\nWe count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street\nAnd ask many questions like children often do\n\n[Chorus]\nWe said, tell me all your thoughts on God\nCause I would really like to meet her\nAnd ask her why we're who we are\nTell me all your thoughts on God\nCause I am on my way to see her\nSo tell me am I very far, am I very far now?\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's getting cold picked up the pace\nHow our shoes make hard noises in this place\nOur clothes are stained\nWe pass many cross-eyed people\nAnd ask many questions like children often do\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me all your thoughts on God\nCause I would really like to meet her\nAnd ask her why we're who we are\nTell me all your thoughts on God\nCause I am on my way to see her\nSo tell me am I very far\nAm I very far now, am I very far now, am I very far now?\nTell me all your thoughts on God\n\n"}
