{"song": "Glycerine", "artist": "Bush", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt must be your skin, I'm sinking in\nIt must be for real cause now I can feel\nAnd I didn't mind\nIt's not my kind, it's not my time to wonder why\nEverything gone white\nEverything's grey\nNow you're here, now you're away\nI don't want this, remember that\nI'll never forget where you're at\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let the days go by\nGlycerine, Glycerine\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm never alone\nI'm alone all the time\nAre you at one, or do you lie\nWe live in a wheel where everyone steals\nBut when we rise it's like strawberry fields\nI treated you bad, you bruise my face\nCouldn't love you more you've got a beautiful taste\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let the days go by\nCould've been easier on you\nI couldn't change though I wanted to\nIt should have been easier by three\nOur old friend fear and you and me\nGlycerine, Glycerine\nDon't let the days go by\nGlycerine\nDon't let the days go by....\nGlycerine, Glycerine\nGlycerine, Glycerine\n\n[Bridge]\nBad moon white again\nBad moon white again\nAs she falls around me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI needed you more, you wanted us less\nI could not kiss, just regress\nIt might just be clear simple and plain\nWell that's just fine that's just one of my names\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let the days go by\nCould've been easier on you, you, you\nGlycerine, Glycerine\nGlycerine, Glycerine\n\n"}
