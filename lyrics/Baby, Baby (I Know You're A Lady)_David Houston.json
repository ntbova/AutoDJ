{"song": "Baby, Baby (I Know You're A Lady)", "artist": "David Houston", "lyrics": "\n\nBaby hear me callin' baby come over here and love me\nHold your lovin' body close to mine\nCrazy you're drivin' me crazy maybe you don't mean to\nBut you never know what's goin' on in a woman's mind\nI know you've been hurt before\nYou don't know what you're lookin' for and you're lonely\nIf you'll only let me stay I will kiss the tears away and love you forever\nBaby I'm on my knees now baby I know that you're a lady\nBut I wanna watch the sun come up with you\nBaby hear me callin' baby come over here and love me\nHold your lovin' body close to mine\nI know that you're a lady but I wanna watch the sun come up with you\nI know that you're a lady but sometimes a lady needs a little lovin' to\n\n"}
