{"song": "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", "artist": "Roberta Flack", "lyrics": "\n\nThe first time, ever I saw your face\nI thought the sun rose in your eyes\nAnd the moon and the stars\nWere the gifts you gave\nTo the dark, and the endless skies\nMy Love\n\nAnd the first time, ever I kissed your mouth\nI felt the earth move in my hands\nLike the trembling heart\nOf a captive bird\nThat was there, at my command\nMy Love\n\nAnd the first time, ever I lay with you\nI felt your heart so close to mine\nAnd I knew our joy\nWould fill the earth\nAnd last, til the end of time\nMy Love\nAnd last, 'til the end of time\nMy love\n\nThe first time, ever I saw\nYour face\nYour face\nYour fa-ace\nYour face\n\n"}
