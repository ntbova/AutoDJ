{"song": "Resistance", "artist": "Muse", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIs our secret safe tonight?\nAnd are we out of sight?\nOr will our world come tumbling down?\nWill they find our hiding place?\nIs this our last embrace?\nOr will the walls start caving in?\n\n[Hook]\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control\n\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right\nIt could be wrong could be....\n\n[Chorus]\nLove is our resistance\nThey'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down\nHold me\nOur lips must always be sealed\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf we live a life in fear\nI'll wait a thousand years\nJust to see you smile again\nKill your prayers for love and peace\nYou'll wake the thought police\nWe can't hide the truth inside\n\n[Hook]\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control\n\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast\nIt could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right\nIt could be wrong could be....\n\n[Chorus]\nLove is our resistance\nThey'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down\nHold me\nOur lips must always be sealed\n\n[Outro]\nThe night has reached its end\nWe can't pretend\nWe must run\nWe must run\nIt's time to run\nTake us away from here\nProtect us from further harm\nResistance\n\n"}
