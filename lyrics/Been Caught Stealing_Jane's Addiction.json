{"song": "Been Caught Stealing", "artist": "Jane's Addiction", "lyrics": "\n\nI've been caught stealing;\nOnce when I was 5...\nI enjoy stealing\nIt's just as simple as that\nWell, it's just a simple fact\nWhen I want something\nI don't want to pay for it\n\nI walk right through the door\nWalk right through the door\nHey all right! If I get by, it's mine\nMine all mine!\n\nMy girl, she's one too\nShe'll go and get her a skirt\nStick it under her shirt\nShe grabbed a razor for me\nAnd she did it just like that\nWhen she wants something\nShe don't want to pay for it\n\nShe walk right through the door\nWalk right through the door\nHey all right! If I get by, it's mine\nMine all mine!\n\nWe sat around the pile\nWe sat and laughed\nWe sat and laughed and\nWaved it into the air!\nAnd we did it just like that\nWhen we want something\nWe don't want to pay for it\n\nWe walk right through the door\nWalk right through the door\nHey, all right! If I get by, it's mine\nMine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine...\n\n"}
