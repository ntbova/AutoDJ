{"song": "Mack The Knife", "artist": "Bobby Darin", "lyrics": "\n\nOh the shark, babe\nHas such teeth, dear\nAnd he shows them\nPearly white\nJust a jackknife\nHas old Macheath, babe\nAnd he keeps it\nOut of sight\n\nYou know when that shark bites\nWith his teeth, babe\nScarlet billows\nStart to spread\nFancy gloves, though\nWears ol' Macheath, babe\nSo there's never, never a trace of red\n\nNow, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh\nLies a body just oozing life. EEK!\nAnd someone's sneaking round the corner\nCould that someone be Mack the Knife?\n\nThere's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know\nWhere a cement bag's just a drooping on down\nOh that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear\nFive'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town\n\nNow did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller?\nHe disappeared, babe\nAfter drawing out all his hard earned cash\nAnd now Macheath spends, just like a sailor\nCould it be, our boy's done something rash?\n\nNow, Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry\nOh, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown\nOh the line forms on the right, babe\nNow that Mackie's back in town\n\nI said, Jenny Diver, oh Suky Tawdry\nLook out, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown\nYes, that line forms on the right, babe\nNow that Mackie's back in town\nLook out ol' Mackie is back!\n\n"}
