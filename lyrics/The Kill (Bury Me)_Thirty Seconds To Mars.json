{"song": "The Kill (Bury Me)", "artist": "Thirty Seconds To Mars", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat if I wanted to break?\nLaugh it all off, in your face\nWhat would you do?\nWhat if I fell to the floor?\nCouldn't take all this, anymore\nWhat would you do, do, do?\n\n[Chorus]\nCome, break me down\nBury me, bury me\nI am finished with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat if I wanted to fight?\nBeg for the rest of my life\nWhat would you do?\nYou say you wanted more\nWhat are you waiting for?\nI'm not running from you\n\n[Chorus]\nCome, break me down\nBury me, bury me\nI am finished with you\nLook in my eyes\nYou're killing me, killing me\nAll I wanted was you\n\n[Bridge]\nI tried to be someone else\nBut nothing seemed to change\nI know now, this is who I really am inside\nFinally found myself, fighting for a chance\nI know now, this is who I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nCome, break me down\nBury me, bury me\nI am finished with you, you, you\nLook in my eyes\nYou're killing me, killing me\nAll I wanted was you\n\n[Outro]\nCome, break me down\nBreak me down, break me down\nWhat if I wanted to break?\nWhat if I, what if I, what if I\nBury me, bury me\n\n"}
