{"song": "My Own Worst Enemy", "artist": "Lit", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?\nI didn't mean to call you that\nI can't remember what was said or what you threw at me\nPlease tell me\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease tell me why my car is in the front yard\nAnd I'm sleeping with my clothes on\nI came in through the window last night\nAnd you're gone, gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy\n'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me\nThe smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette\nStill burning\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease tell me why my car is in the front yard\nAnd I'm sleeping with my clothes on\nI came in through the window last night\nAnd you're gone, gone\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease tell me why my car is in the front yard\nAnd I'm sleeping with my clothes on\nI came in through the window last night\n\n[Outro]\nIt's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy\n'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me\nCan we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?\nI didn't mean to call you that\n\n"}
