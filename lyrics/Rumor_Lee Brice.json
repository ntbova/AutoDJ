{"song": "Rumor", "artist": "Lee Brice", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nGirl you know I've known you forever\nHow many nights we hung out together\nSame little crowd, little bar, little town\nRound this old dance floor\nMy boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder\nMaking a motion like \"'Could y'all get any closer?\"\nThey wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya\nEven when the song is over\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a rumor going round about me and you\nStirring up our little town the last week or two\nSo tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling\nI feel it, don't you feel it too?\nThere's a rumor going round, and round, and round\nWhat d'you say we make it true?\nWe make it true\nOh, we make it true\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy\nI can do whatever you want me to do, baby\nOr you could lay one on me right now\nWe could really give them something to talk about\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a rumor going round about me and you\nStirring up our little town the last week or two\nSo tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling\nI feel it, don't you feel it too?\nThere's a rumor going round, and round, and round\nWhat d'you say we make it true, baby?\n\n[Bridge]\nOh be honest girl now\nDo you want to do this or not?\nShould we keep them talking, girl\nOr should we just make them stop?\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a rumor going round about me and you\nStirring up our little town the last week or two\nSo tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling\nI feel it, and you feel it too\nThere's a rumor going round, and round, and round\nWhatd'you say we make it-\nMake it true?\nWhatd'you say we make it true?\nCome on over here\nLet's really give them something to talk about, baby\nThere's a rumor going round\n\n"}
