{"song": "Love Without End, Amen", "artist": "George Strait", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye\nFighting was against the rules and it didn't matter why\nWhen dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed\nAnd then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd he said, \"Let me tell you a secret about a father's love\nA secret that my daddy said was just between us\u201d\nHe said, \"Daddies don't just love their children every now and then\nIt's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I became a father in the spring of '81\nThere was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son\nAnd when I thought my patience had been tested to the end\nI took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLast night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates\nWhen suddenly I realized there must be some mistake\nIf they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in\nAnd then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again\n\n[Chorus]\n\n"}
