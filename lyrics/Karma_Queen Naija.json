{"song": "Karma", "artist": "Queen Naija", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI held you down for the longest\nAnd I was there through all of your darkest moments\nFeels just like yesterday when we were homeless\nGotchu some bread and start treating me bogus\nTalking 'bout you wanted something new (something new)\nLike I wasn't good enough for you (good for you)\nGuess you done caught you a case of amnesia\nMaybe you should take a look in your rear view\n'Cause obviously you forgot all the times that I held you when you cried\nAnd don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?\nNo I guess not, I guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot\nCongratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now (you got now babe)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)\nYou made it clear that you're unhappy (unhappy, yeah)\nGo ahead and have your fun now (fun now)\nJust remember what goes around, comes around\nYou don't gotta worry 'bout me (don't gotta worry, baby)\nYou made it clear that you're unhappy (you're unhappy, yeah)\nGo ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)\nJust remember what goes around, comes around\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember when you said that you could have somebody better\nAnd I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up\nHad me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself\nWishin' that I looked like someone else\nLike the girls you liked on Instagram (damn)\nAnd you really had the nerve to call me insecure\nMaybe it wasn't you\nMaybe it's true I didn't know my worth (didn't know my worth)\nMaybe, maybe I should've loved me first (loved me first)\nMaybe, maybe I should've loved me first\n\n[Chorus]\nSo you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)\nYou made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)\nGo ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)\nJust remember what goes around, comes around\nYou don't gotta worry 'bout me (you don't gotta worry, no)\nYou made it clear that you're unhappy (made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah)\nGo ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now, yeah)\nJust remember what goes around, comes around (come around)\n\n[Outro]\nAround, around, (yeah) around\nWhat goes around it comes around, ay\nAround, around, (yeah) around\nWhat goes around it comes around, yeah\nAround, around, (yeah) around\nOoh\n\n"}
