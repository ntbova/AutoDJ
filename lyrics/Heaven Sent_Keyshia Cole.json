{"song": "Heaven Sent", "artist": "Keyshia Cole", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nSent from heaven\nSent from heaven\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow you can wait your whole life wondering\nWhen it's gonna come or where it's been\nYou may have got your heart broken\nA few times in the past\nNever last strong as it used to\nDon't feel as good as it used to (before)\nAnd all the things you used to say\nThings you used to do, went right out the door\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nOh no more, will you be the one\nThat's what you tell everyone around you\nBut you know they've heard it all before\nWhat more can you say\nWhen love won't let you, walk away\nAnd you can't help who you love\nAnd you find yourself giving it away\nWhen you think you're in love\n\n[Hook: 2x]\nI wanna be the one who you believe\nIn your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)\nThere's a piece of me who leaves when you gone\nBecause you're sent from (sent from heaven)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you can wait your whole life tryna change\nWhat the fear from what it's been\nYou may have put your whole life into a man\nLoving what you thought that could've been\nNotice when you change\nWhen you don't feel as good as you used to (before)\nAnd everything you used to say\nEverything you used to do clear right out the door\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nEverybody say\nI wanna be the one you love\nI wanna be (sent from heaven)\nEverybody say I wanna be the one you trust\nI wanna be (sent from heaven)\nEverybody say I wanna be the one you need\nI wanna be (sent from heaven)\nEverybody say I wanna be the one who sent from heaven\n\n[Hook: 3x]\n\n"}
