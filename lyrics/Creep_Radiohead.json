{"song": "Creep", "artist": "Radiohead", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen you were here before\nCouldn't look you in the eye\nYou're just like an angel\nYour skin makes me cry\nYou float like a feather\nIn a beautiful world\nI wish I was special\nYou're so fuckin' special\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm a creep\nI'm a weirdo\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nI don't belong here\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't care if it hurts\nI wanna have control\nI want a perfect body\nI want a perfect soul\nI want you to notice\nWhen I'm not around\nYou're so fuckin' special\nI wish I was special\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm a creep\nI'm a weirdo\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nI don't belong here\n\n[Bridge]\nShe's running out the door\nShe's running out\nShe run, run, run, run\nRun\n\n[Outro]\nWhatever makes you happy\nWhatever you want\nYou're so fuckin' special\nI wish I was special\nBut I'm a creep\nI'm a weirdo\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\nI don't belong here\nI don't belong here\n\n"}
