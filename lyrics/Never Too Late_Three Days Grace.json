{"song": "Never Too Late", "artist": "Three Days Grace", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis world will never be what I expected\nAnd if I don't belong, who would have guessed it?\nI will not leave alone everything that I own\nTo make you feel like it's not too late\nIt's never too late\n\n[Chorus]\nEven if I say it'll be alright\nStill I hear you say you want to end your life\nNow and again we try to just stay alive\nMaybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late\nIt's never too late\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo one will ever see the side reflected\nAnd if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it?\nAnd I have left alone everything that I own\nTo make you feel like it's not too late\nIt's never too late\n\n[Chorus]\nEven if I say it'll be alright\nStill I hear you say you want to end your life\nNow and again we try to just stay alive\nMaybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late\nIt's never too late\n\n[Bridge]\nThe world we knew won't come back\nTime we've lost, can't get back\nLife we had won't be ours again\n\nThis world will never be what I expected\nAnd if I don't belong\n\n[Chorus]\nEven if I say it'll be alright\nStill I hear you say you want to end your life\nNow and again we try to just stay alive\nMaybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's not too late\nIt's never too late\nMaybe we'll turn it all around\n'Cause it's not too late\nIt's never too late (It's never too late)\nIt's not too late\nIt's never too late\n\n"}
