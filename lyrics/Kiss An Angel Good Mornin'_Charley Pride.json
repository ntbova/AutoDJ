{"song": "Kiss An Angel Good Mornin'", "artist": "Charley Pride", "lyrics": "\n\nWhenever I chance to meet\nSome old friends on the street\nThey wonder how does a man get to be this way\nI've always got a smiling face\nAnytime and any place\nAnd everytime they ask me why\nI just smile and say\n\nYou've got to\nKiss an angel good morning\nAnd let her know you think about her when you're gone\nKiss an angel good morning\nAnd love her like the devil when you get back home\n\nWell people may try to guess\nThe secret of a happiness\nBut some of them never learn it's a simple thing\n\nThe secret i'm speaking of\nIs a woman and a man in love\nAnd the answer is in this song\nThat i always sing\n\nYou've got to\nKiss an angel good morning\nAnd let you know you think about her when you're gone\nKiss an angel good morning\nAnd love her like the devil when you get back home\n\nKiss an angel good morning\nAnd let you know you think about her when you're gone\nKiss an angel good morning\nAnd love her like the devil when you get back home\n\n"}
