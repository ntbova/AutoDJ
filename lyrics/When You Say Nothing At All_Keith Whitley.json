{"song": "When You Say Nothing At All", "artist": "Keith Whitley", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1: Keith Whitley]\nIt's amazing how you can speak right to my heart\nWithout saying a word you can light up the dark\nTry as I may I could never explain\nWhat I hear when you don't say a thing\n\n[Chorus: Keith Whitley]\nThe smile on your face lets me know that you need me\nThere's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me\nA touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall\nNow you say it best when you say nothing at all\n\n[Verse 2: Keith Whitley]\nAll day long I can hear people talking out loud\nBut when you hold me near you drown out the crowd\nOld Mister Webster could never define\nWhat's being said between your heart and mine\n\n[Chorus: Keith Whitley]\nThe smile on your face lets me know that you need me\nThere's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me\nA touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall\nNow you say it best when you say nothing at all\n\n[Chorus: Keith Whitley]\nThe smile on your face lets me know that you need me\nThere's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me\nA touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall\nNow you say it best when you say nothing at all\n\n"}
