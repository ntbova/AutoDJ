Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you\nI want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you\nBut when you get there you just tell me you\u2019re not hungry at all\nYou said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk\nYou like to think that I\u2019m just crazy when I say that you've changed\nI\u2019m convinced I know the problem: you don't love me the same\nYou\u2019re just going through the motions and you\u2019re not being fair\nI've got my pride, I will not cry\nStill I can't help but care\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not your superwoman, oh no no no\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm only human)\nThis girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me\nI'm not your superwoman\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm only human, yeah)\nThis girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh baby\nLook into the corners of your mind\nI'll always be there for you through good and bad times\nBut I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be\nI'll give my love, everlasting love if you'll return love to me\nI\u2019m not your superwoman\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not your superwoman, oh no, oh no\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm only human)\nThis girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me\n\n[Bridge]\nAh, ha, if you feel it in your heart and you understand me\nStop right where you are, everybody sing along with me\n(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo\u2026hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)\nI\u2019m the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet\nBut you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me\n(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo\u2026hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)\nI need love\nI need just your love\nI'm not your superwoman\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not your superwoman, oh no\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm only human)\nThis girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me\n\n"}
