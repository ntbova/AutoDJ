{"song": "Down To The Honkytonk", "artist": "Jake Owen", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got a house down a back road\nI got a flag on the front pourch\nI got a dog named Waylon\nI got a driveway that needs pavin'\nI got a boat with a two stroke\nA couple 'guaranteed to make ya laugh' jokes\nI got friends in low places\nYeah, life is what you make it\n\n[Chorus]\nI might not end up in the Hall of Fame\nWith a star on the sidewalk with my name\nOr a statue in my hometown when I'm gone\nNobody gonna name their babies after me\nI might not go down in history\nBut I'll go down to the honkytonk\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a girl, named Shelia\nShe goes batshit on tequila\nGot a job, that gets the job done\nI got a loan at the bank, it's a big one\nThe only place you might see my name\nIs on the wall for a goodtime call\nI'm a local legend on a Friday night\nThen a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a neon light\n\n[Chorus]\nI might not end up in the Hall of Fame\nWith a star on the sidewalk with my name\nOr a statue in my hometown when I'm gone\nNobody gonna name their babies after me\nI might not go down in history\nBut I'll go down to the honkytonk\n\n[Bridge]\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down, I go down to the honkytonk\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down, I go down to the honkytonk\n\n[Chorus]\nI might not end up in the Hall of Fame\nWith a star on the sidewalk with my name\nOr a statue in my hometown when I'm gone\nNobody gonna name their babies after me\nI might not go down in history\nBut I'll go down to the honkytonk\n\n[Outro]\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down, I go down to the honkytonk\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down to the honkytonk\nI go down, I go down to the honkytonk\n\n"}
