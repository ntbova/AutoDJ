{"song": "Live Like You Were Dying", "artist": "Tim McGraw", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSaid I was in my early 40's\nWith a lot of life before me\nWhen a moment came that stopped me on a dime\nI spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays\nTalkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time\nAsked him when it sank in\nThat this might really be the real end\nHow's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news\nMan what ya do\nAnd he says\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI went sky divin'\nI went Rocky Mountain climbin'\nI went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu\nAnd I loved deeper\nAnd I spoke sweeter\nAnd I gave forgiveness I've been denying\nAnd he said someday I hope you get the chance\nTo live like you were dyin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe said I was finally the husband\nThat most the time I wasn't\nAnd I became a friend a friend would like to have\nAnd all the sudden goin' fishing\nWasn't such an imposition\nAnd I went three times that year I lost my dad\nWell I finally read the good book\nAnd I took a good long hard look at what I'd do\nIf I could do it all again\nAnd then\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI went sky divin'\nI went Rocky Mountain climbin'\nI went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu\nAnd I loved deeper\nAnd I spoke sweeter\nAnd I gave forgiveness I've been denying\nAnd he said someday I hope you get the chance\nTo live like you were dyin'\n\n[Bridge]\nLike tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity\nTo think about what you do with it\nWhat could you do with it, what can\nI do with with it, what would I do with it\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSky divin'\nI went Rocky Mountain climbin'\nI went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu\nAnd I loved deeper\nAnd I spoke sweeter\nAnd I watched an eagle as it was flying\nAnd he said someday I hope you get the chance\nTo live like you were dyin'\n\n[Outro]\nTo live like you were dyin'\nTo live like you were dyin'\nTo live like you were dyin'\nTo live like you were dyin'\n\n"}
