{"song": "19 Somethin'", "artist": "Mark Wills", "lyrics": "\n\nI saw Star Wars at least 8 times\nHad the pac-man pattern memorized\nAnd I've seen the stuff they put inside\nStretch Armstrong\n\nI was Roger Stauback back in my back yard\nHad a shoebox full of baseball cards\nAnd a couple of Evil Kinevil scars\nOn my right arm\nWell, I was a kid when Elvis died\nAnd my mama cried\n\nChorus:\nIt was 1970- something\nIn the world that I grew up in\nFarrah Faucett hair-do days\nBell bottoms and 8-track tapes\nLookin' back now I can see me\nAnd oh, man did I look cheesy\nBut I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'\nIt was 1970-something\n\nIt was the dawning of a new decade\nWhen we got our first microwave\nAnd Dad broke down and finally shaved\nThose sideburns off\nI took the stickers off of my Rubix cube\nWatched MTV all afternoon\nMy first love was Daisy Duke\nIn them cut off jeans\nA Space Shuttle fell out of the sky\nAnd the whole world cried\n\nChorus:\nIt was 1980-something\nIn the world that I grew up in\nSkating rinks and Black Trans Ams\nBig hair and parachute pants\nLookin' back now I can see me\nAnd oh, man did I look cheesy\nBut I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'\nIt was 1980-something\n\nNow I got a mortgage and an SUV\nBut all this responsibility\nMakes me wish sometimes\nSometimes....\n\nChorus:\nIt was 1980-something\nIn the world that I grew up in\nSkating rinks and Black Trans Ams\nBig hair and parachute pants\nLookin' back now I can see me\nAnd oh, man did I look cheesy\nBut I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'\nIt was 1980-something\n\n1970-something\nAw, it was 19-Something\n\n"}
