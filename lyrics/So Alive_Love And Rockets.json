{"song": "So Alive", "artist": "Love And Rockets", "lyrics": "\n\nI don't know what color your eyes are, baby\nBut your hair is long and brown\nYour legs are strong, and you're so, so long\nAnd you don't come from this town\n\nMy head is full of magic, baby\nAnd I can't share this with you\nFeel I'm on a cross again, lately\nBut there's nothing to do with you\n\nI'm alive, so alive\nI'm alive, so alive\n\nYour strut makes me crazy\nMakes me see you more clearly\nOh, baby, now I can see you\nWish I could stop\nSwitch off the clock\nMake it all happen for you\n\nI'm alive, so alive\nI'm alive, so alive\n\nI don't know what color your eyes are, baby\nBut your hair is long and brown\nYour legs are strong, and you're so, so long\nAnd you don't come from this town\n\nMy head is full of magic, baby\nAnd I can't share this with you\nI feel I'm on top again, baby\nThat's got everything to do with you\n\nI'm alive, so alive\nI'm alive, so alive\n\n"}
