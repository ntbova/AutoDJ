{"song": "You Light Up My Life", "artist": "Debby Boone", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo many nights\nI'd sit by my window\nWaiting for someone\nTo sing me his song\n\nSo many dreams\nI've kept deep inside me\nAlone in the dark\nBut now you've come along\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you\nLight up my life\nYou give me hope\nTo carry on\nYou light up my days\nAnd fill my nights\nWith song\n\n[Verse 2]\nRolling at sea\nAdrift on the waters\nCould it be finally\nI'm turning for home?\nFinally, a chance\nTo say, \"Hey, I love you,\"\nNever again\nTo be all alone\n\n[Chorus] x2\n\n[Outro]\nIt can't be wrong\nWhen it feels so right\n'Cause you\nYou light up my life\n\n"}
