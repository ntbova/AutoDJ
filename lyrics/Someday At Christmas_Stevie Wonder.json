{"song": "Someday At Christmas", "artist": "Stevie Wonder", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSomeday at Christmas men won't be boys\nPlaying with bombs like kids play with toys\nOne warm December our hearts will see\nA world where men are free\n\nSomeday at Christmas there'll be no wars\nWhen we have learned what Christmas is for\nWhen we have found what life's really worth\nThere'll be peace on earth\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday all our dreams will come to be\nSomeday in a world where men are free\nMaybe not in time for you and me\nBut someday at Christmastime\n\n[Verse 2]\nSomeday at Christmas we'll see a land\nWith no hungry children, no empty hand\nOne happy morning people will share\nOur world where people care\n\nSomeday at Christmas there'll be no tears\nAll men are equal and no men have fears\nOne shining moment, one prayer away\nFrom our world today\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday all our dreams will come to be\nSomeday in a world where men are free\nMaybe not in time for you and me\nBut someday at Christmastime\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomeday at Christmas man will not fail\nHate will be gone and love will prevail\nSomeday a new world that we can start\nWith hope in every heart\n\n[Chorus]\n(Someday all our dreams will come to be)\n(Someday in a world where men are free)\nMaybe not in time for you and me\nBut someday at Christmastime\nSomeday at Christmastime\n\n"}
