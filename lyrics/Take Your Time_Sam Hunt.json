{"song": "Take Your Time", "artist": "Sam Hunt", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI don't know if you were looking at me or not\nYou probably smile like that all the time\nAnd I don't mean to bother you but\nI couldn't just walk by\nAnd not say hi\nAnd I know your name\nCause everybody in here knows your name\nAnd you're not looking for anything right now\nSo I don't wanna come on strong\nDon't get me wrong\nYour eyes are so intimidating\nMy heart is pounding but\nIt's just a conversation\nNo girl I'm not wasted\nYou don't know me\nI don't know you but I want to\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna steal your freedom\nI don't wanna change your mind\nI don't have to make you love me\nI just want to take your time\nI don't wanna wreck your Friday\nI ain't gonna waste my lines\nI don't have to take your heart\nI just wanna take your time\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I know it starts with hello\nAnd the next thing you know you're try to be nice\nAnd some guys getting too close\nTrying to pick you up\nTrying to get you drunk\nAnd I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here\nCause she's supposed to save you from random guys\nThat talk too much and wanna stay too long\nIt's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well\nYou could've rolled your eyes\nTold me to go to hell\nCould've walked away\nBut you're still here\nAnd I'm still here\nCome on let's see where it goes\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI don't wanna steal your freedom\nI don't wanna change your mind\nI don't have to make you love me\nI just wanna take your time\nI don't have to meet your mother\nWe don't have to cross that line\nI don't wanna steal your covers\nI just wanna take your time\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't wanna go home with you\nI just wanna be alone with you\n\n[Chorus 3]\nI don't wanna steal your freedom\nI don't wanna change your mind\nI don't have to make you love me\nI just wanna take your time\nI don't wanna blow your phone up\nI just wanna blow your mind\nI don't have to take your heart\nI just wanna take your time\nNo, I ain't gotta call you baby\nAnd I ain't gotta call you mine\nI don't have to take your heart\nI just wanna take your time\n\n"}
