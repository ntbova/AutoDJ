{"song": "Bad Day", "artist": "Daniel Powter", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhere is the moment we needed the most?\nYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lost\nThey tell me your blue skies fade to gray\nThey tell me your passion's gone away\nAnd I don't need no carryin' on\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou stand in the line just to hit a new low\nYou're faking a smile with the coffee to go\nYou tell me your life's been way off line\nYou're falling to pieces every time\nAnd I don't need no carryin' on\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause you had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song just to turn it around\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me, don't lie\nYou work at a smile and you go for a ride\nYou had a bad day\nThe camera don't lie\nYou're coming back down and you really don't mind\nYou had a bad day\nYou had a bad day\n\n[Verse 3]\nWill you need a blue sky holiday?\nThe point is they laugh at what you say\nAnd I don't need no carryin' on\n\n[Chorus]\nYou had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song just to turn it around\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me, don't lie\nYou work at a smile and you go for a ride\nYou had a bad day\nThe camera don't lie\nYou're coming back down and you really don't mind\nYou had a bad day\n(Ooh, a holiday)\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes the system goes on the blink\nAnd the whole thing turns out wrong\nYou might not make it back and you know\nThat you could be well, oh, that strong\nAnd I'm not wrong\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Breakdown]\nSo where is the passion when you need it the most?\nOh, you and I\nYou kick up the leaves and the magic is lost\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you had a bad day\nYou're taking one down\nYou sing a sad song just to turn it around\nYou say you don't know\nYou tell me don't lie\nYou work at a smile and you go for a ride\nYou had a bad day\nYou've seen what you're like\nAnd how does it feel?\nOne more time\nYou had a bad day\nYou had a bad day\n\n[Outro]\nAh, yeah, yeah, yeah\nHad a bad day (ah)\nHad a bad day (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nHad a bad day (ah)\n\n"}
