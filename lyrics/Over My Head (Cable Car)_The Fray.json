{"song": "Over My Head (Cable Car)", "artist": "The Fray", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI never knew\nI never knew that everything was falling through\nThat everyone I knew was waiting on a cue\nTo turn and run when all I needed was the truth\nBut that's how it's gotta be\nIt's coming down to nothing more than apathy\nI'd rather run the other way than stay and see\nThe smoke and who's still standing when it clears\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd everyone knows I'm in\nOver my head\nOver my head\nWith eight seconds left in overtime\nShe's on your mind, she's on your mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet's rearrange\nI wish you were a stranger I could disengage\nSay that we agree and then never change\nSoften a bit until we all just get along\nBut that's disregard\nFind another friend and you discard\nAs you lose the argument in a cable car\nHanging above as the canyon comes between\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd everyone knows I'm in\nOver my head\nOver my head\nWith eight seconds left in overtime\nShe's on your mind\nShe's on your mind\nEveryone knows I'm in\nOver my head\nOver my head\nWith eight seconds left in overtime\nShe's on your mind\nShe's on, on\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd suddenly, I've become a part of your past\nI'm becoming the part that don't last\nI'm losing you and it's effortless\nWithout a sound, we lose sight of the ground\nIn the throw around\nNever thought that you wanted to bring it down\nI won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd everyone knows I'm in\nOver my head\nOver my head\nWith eight seconds left in overtime\nShe's on your mind\nShe's on your mind\nEveryone knows\nShe's on your mind\nEveryone knows I'm in\nOver my head\nI'm in over my head, I'm over my...\nEveryone knows I'm in\nOver my head\nOver my head\nWith eight seconds left in overtime\nShe's on your mind\nShe's on your mind\n\n"}
