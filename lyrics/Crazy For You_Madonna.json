{"song": "Crazy For You", "artist": "Madonna", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSwaying room as the music starts\nStrangers making the most of the dark\nTwo by two their bodies become one\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see you through the smokey air\nCan't you feel the weight of my stare\nYou're so close but still a world away\nWhat I'm dying to say, is that\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm crazy for you\nTouch me once and you'll know it's true\nI never wanted anyone like this\nIt's all brand new\nYou'll feel it in my kiss\nI'm crazy for you, crazy for you\n\n[Verse 3]\nTrying hard to control my heart\nI walk over to where you are\nEye to eye we need no words at all\n\n[Verse 4]\nSlowly now we begin to move\nEvery breath I'm deeper into you\nSoon we two are standing still in time\nIf you read my mind, you'll see\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm crazy for you\nTouch me once and you'll know it's true\nI never wanted anyone like this\nIt's all brand new\nYou'll feel it in my kiss\nYou'll feel it in my kiss\nBecause I'm crazy for you\nTouch me once and you'll know it's true\nI never wanted anyone like this\nIt's all brand new\nYou'll feel it in my kiss\nI'm crazy for you\nCrazy for you\nCrazy for you\n\n[Outro]\nIt's all brand new, I'm crazy for you\nAnd you know it's true\nI'm crazy, crazy for you\nIt's all brand new, I'm crazy for you\nAnd you know it's true\nYeah, I'm crazy for you\nCrazy for you, baby\nI'm crazy for you\nCrazy for you, baby\n\n"}
