{"song": "Pickup Man", "artist": "Joe Diffie", "lyrics": "\n\nWell, I got my first truck when I was three\nDrove a hundred thousand miles on my knees\nHauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before\nI hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door\nShe tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand\nThere's something women like about a pickup man\n\nWhen I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks\nMy first car was a pickup truck\nI was cruising the town and the first girl I seen\nWas Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen\nShe flagged me down and climbed up in the cab\nAnd said, \"I never knew you were a pickup man\"\n\nYou can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill\nAnd I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville\nI got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made\nYou know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates\nI met all my wives in traffic jams\nThere's just something women like about a pickup man\n\nMost Friday nights I can be found\nIn the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge\nBacked into my spot at the drive-in show\nYou know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow\nI never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand\nCause there's something women like about a pickup man\n\nYou can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill\nAnd I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville\nI got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made\nYou know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates\nI met all my wives in traffic jams\nThere's just something women like about a pickup man\n\nA bucket of rust or a brand new machine\nOnce around the block and you'll know what I mean\n\nYou can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill\nAnd I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville\nI got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made\nYou know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates\nI met all my wives in traffic jams\nThere's just something women like about a pickup man\nYeah, there's something women like about a pickup man\n\n"}
