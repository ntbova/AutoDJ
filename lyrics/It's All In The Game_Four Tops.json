{"song": "It's All In The Game", "artist": "Four Tops", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nMany a tear have to fall\nBut it's all in the game\nAll in the wonderful game\nThat we know as love\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou have words with him\nAnd your future's looking dim\nBut these things\nYour hearts can rise, rise above above\n\n[Verse 3]\nOnce in a while he will call\nBut it's all in the game\nSoon he'll be there at your side\nWith a sweet, a sweet bouquet\nWith a sweet bouquet\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd he'll kiss your lips\nAnd caress your waiting fingertips\nAnd your heart, your hearts got to fly fly\nFly way\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd he'll kiss your lips\nAnd caress your waiting fingertips\nAnd your heart, your hearts got to fly away\n\n[Outro]\nIt's all in the game, the game called love\nIt's all in the game, the game called love\n\n"}
