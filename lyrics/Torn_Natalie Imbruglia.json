{"song": "Torn", "artist": "Natalie Imbruglia", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI thought I saw a man brought to life\nHe was warm, he came around like he was dignified\nHe showed me what it was to cry\nWell, you couldn't be that man I adored\nYou don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for\nBut I don't know him anymore\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere's nothing where he used to lie\nMy conversation has run dry\nThat's what's going on\n\n[Chorus]\nNothing's fine, I'm torn\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I guess the fortune teller's right\nShould have seen just what was there\nAnd not some holy light\nBut you crawled beneath my veins\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd now I don't care, I had no luck\nI don't miss it all that much\nThere's just so many things\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I can touch, I'm torn\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\nTorn\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's nothing where he used to lie\nMy inspiration has run dry\nThat's what's going on\n\n[Chorus]\nNothing's right, I'm torn\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\n\n[Outro]\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I'm ashamed\nBound and broken on the floor\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn...\nTorn\nOh\n(Oh yeah, a little)\n(Oh yeah, a little)\n(Oh yeah, a little)\n\n"}
