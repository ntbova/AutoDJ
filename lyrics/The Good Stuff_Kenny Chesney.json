{"song": "The Good Stuff", "artist": "Kenny Chesney", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, me and my lady had our first big fight\nSo I drove around till I saw the neon light\nA corner bar, and it just seemed right\nSo I pulled up\n\n[Verse 2]\nNot a soul around but the old bar keep\nDown at the end and looking half asleep\nAnd he walked up, and said: \"What'll it be?\"\nI said: \"The good stuff\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe didn't reach around for the whiskey;\nHe didn't pour me a beer\nHis blue eyes kind of went misty\nHe said: \"You can't find that here\n\n[Chorus 1]\nBecause it's the first long kiss on a second date\nMomma's all worried when you get home late\nAnd dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate\nBecause your hands are shaking so much\nAnd it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair\nEating burnt suppers the whole first year\nAnd asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up\nYeah, man, that's the good stuff\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass\nAnd I smiled and said: \"I'll have some of that\"\nWe sat there and talked as an hour passed\nLike old friends\n\n[Verse 5]\nI saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare\nIt was a pretty girl with bouffant hair\nHe said: \"That's my Bonnie\nTaken about a year after we were wed\"\n\n[Verse 6]\nHe said \"Spent five years in the bottle\nWhen the cancer took her from me\nBut I've been sober three years now\nBecause the one thing stronger than the whiskey\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWas the sight of her holding my baby girl\nThe way she adored that string of pearls\nI gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl\nMarried his high school love\nAnd it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'\nBeing right there as our time got small\nAnd holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up\nYeah, man, that's the good stuff\"\n\n[Outro]\nHe said: \"When you get home, she'll start to cry\nWhen she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'\nAnd look into those eyes, so deep in love\nAnd drink it up\nBecause that's the good stuff\nThat's the good stuff\"\n\n"}
