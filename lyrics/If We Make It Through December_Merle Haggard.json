{"song": "If We Make It Through December", "artist": "Merle Haggard", "lyrics": "\n\n[Chorus]\nIf we make it through December\nEverything's going to be all right I know\nIt's the coldest time of winter\nAnd I shiver when I see the falling snow\nIf we make it through December\nGot plans to be in a warmer town come summer time\nMaybe even California\nIf we make it through December we'll be fine\n\n[Verse]\nGot laid off down at the factory\nAnd their timing is not the greatest in the world\nHeaven knows I been working hard\nI wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl\nNow I don't mean to hate December\nIt's meant to be the happy time of year\nAnd my little girl don't understand\nWhy daddy can't afford no Christmas gift\n\n[Chorus]\nIf we make it through December\nEverything's going to be all right I know\nIt's the coldest time of winter\nAnd I shiver when I see the falling snow\nIf we make it through December\nGot plans to be in a warmer town come summer time\nMaybe even California\nIf we make it through December we'll be fine\n\n"}
