{"song": "Wanted", "artist": "Hunter Hayes", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou know I'd fall apart without you\nI don't know how you do what you do\n'Cause everything that don't make sense about me\nMakes sense when I'm with you\nLike everything that's green, girl\nI need you\nBut it's more than one and one makes two\nPut aside the math and the logic of it\nYou gotta know you're wanted too\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I wanna wrap you up\nWanna kiss your lips\nI wanna make you feel wanted\nAnd I wanna call you mine\nWanna hold your hand forever\nAnd never let you forget it\nYeah, I wanna make you feel wanted\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnyone can tell you you're pretty\nYou get that all the time, I know you do\nBut your beauty's deeper than the makeup\nAnd I wanna show you what I see tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I wrap you up\nWhen I kiss your lips\nI wanna make you feel wanted\nAnd I wanna call you mine\nWanna hold your hand forever\nAnd never let you forget it\n'Cause baby I, wanna make you feel wanted\n\n[Bridge]\nAs good as you make me feel\nI wanna make you feel better\nBetter than your fairy tales\nBetter than your best dreams\nYou're more than everything I need\nYou're all I ever wanted\nAll I ever wanted\n\n[Chorus/Outro]\nAnd I just wanna wrap you up\nWanna kiss your lips\nI wanna make you feel wanted\nAnd I wanna call you mine\nWanna hold your hand forever\nNever let you forget it\nYeah, I wanna make you feel wanted\nYeah, baby I wanna make you feel\nWanted\n\n[Outro]\nCause you'll always be wanted\n\n"}
