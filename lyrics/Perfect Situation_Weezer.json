{"song": "Perfect Situation", "artist": "Weezer", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat's the deal with my brain?\nWhy am I so obviously insane?\nIn a perfect situation\nI let love down the drain\nThere's the pitch, slow and straight\nAll I have to do is swing\nAnd I'm a hero, but I'm a zero\n\n[Verse 2]\nHungry nights, once again\nNow it's getting unbelievable\nCause I could not have it better\nBut I just can't get no play\nFrom the girls, all around\nAs they search the night for someone to hold onto\nAnd I just pass through...\n\n[Chorus]\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh\n\n[Verse 3]\nGet your hands off the girl\nCan't you see that she belongs to me?\nAnd I don't appreciate this excess company\nThough I can't satisfy all the needs she has\nAnd so she starts to wander...\nCan you blame her?\n\n[Chorus]\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh\n\n[Bridge]\nTell me there's a logic out there\nLeading me to better prepare\nFor the day that something really special might come\nTell me there's some hope for me\nI don't wanna be lonely\nFor the rest of my days on the earth\nOh..!!\n\n[Chorus]\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh\nSinging...\nOoohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh\n\n[Outro]\nSinging...\nOoohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...\n\n"}
