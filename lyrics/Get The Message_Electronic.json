Look where you've been\nI've counted the nights, living in sin\nHow can we talk? Look where we've been\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake my independent point of view\nI've loosened my wallet, thanks to you\nDon't do me any favors\nHark, the herald angels sting\nPlease repair my broken wing\nWhy won't you look at me? I live and breathe\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know where to begin, living in sin\nHow can we talk? Look where you've been\nI've counted the nights of living in sin\nHow can we talk? Look where we've been\n\nI don't know where to begin, living in sin\nHow can we talk? Look where you've been\nI've counted the nights of living in sin\nHow can we talk? Look where we've been\n\n(We can make it all the time, to live or die)\n(We can make it all the time, to live or die)\n\n[Outro]\nLiving on peanuts ain't my scene\nA shame that word rhymes with \"mean\"\n\n"}
