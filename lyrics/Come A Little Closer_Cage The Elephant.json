{"song": "Come A Little Closer", "artist": "Cage The Elephant", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nTime shakes, found you at the water\nAt first you were my father, now I love you like a brother\nEarthquakes shake the dust behind you\nThis world at times will blind you\nStill I know I'll see you there\n\n[Chorus]\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\nCome on, come on, come on\nThings aren't always what they seem to be\nCome on, come on, come on\nDo you understand the things that you've been seeing?\nCome on, come on, come on\nDo you understand the things that you've been dreaming?\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\n\n[Verse 2]\nHeartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders\nWill we burn on or just smolder?\nSomehow I know I'll find you there\nOooh, you wanna see if you can change it, change it\nStill I know I'll see you there\n\n[Chorus]\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\nCome on, come on, come on\nThings aren't always what they seem to be\nDo you understand the things that you've been seeing?\nCome on, come on, come on\nDo you understand the things that you've been dreaming?\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\n\n[Bridge]\nTen thousand people stand alone now\nAnd in the evening the sun sank\nTomorrow it will rise\n\"Time flies by,\" they all sang along\n\"Time flies by,\" they all sang along\n\"Time flies by,\" they all sang along\n\"Time flies by... by\"\n\n[Chorus]\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\nCome on, come on, come on\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\nCome a little closer, then you'll see\n\n"}
