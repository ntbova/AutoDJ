{"song": "A Tight Ship", "artist": "David Gray", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe better then to know myself\nThat fear be damned and love be wealth\nTo sing it like a mountain stream\nTo dance like no one sees\nThat blinked an eye, that flashed a smile\nBut missed it by a country mile\nNow sleek to dive in mirrored pools\nAnd dance like no one sees\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo seize the day, yeah aim it true\nWe\u2019ll live the way that lovers do\nWe\u2019ll go defenseless, open wide\nWe\u2019ll let the senses be our guide\nWe\u2019ll break the surface, snip these strings\nRelearn the grace of selfless things\nWe\u2019ll dance like no one sees\nDance like no one sees\nWe\u2019ll dance like no one sees\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd sleek to dive in mirrored pools\nSo sleek to dive in mirrored pools\nIn mirrored pools, so sleek to dive\nAnd kiss the face, yeah snip these strings\nRelearn the grace of selfless things\nThen sleek to dive\n(Tonight we dance like no one sees us)\nAnd sleek to dive\n(Tonight we dance like no one sees us)\n(Tonight we dance like no one sees)\n\n"}
