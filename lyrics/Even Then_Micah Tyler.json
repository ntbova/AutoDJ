{"song": "Even Then", "artist": "Micah Tyler", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn the nights when the dark last a little bit longer\nWhen the wind and the storm is a little bit stronger\nWhen the fear in my heart dips a little bit deeper\nWhen my faith to stand gets a little bit weaker\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhere could I run to?\nWhere could I go?\n\n[Chorus]\nEven when it feels like my world is shaken\nEven when I've had all that I can take\nI know\nYou never let me go\nAnd even when the waters won't stop rising\nEven when I'm caught in the dead of a night\nI know\nNo matter how it ends\nYou're with me even then\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the days up ahead look a little bit brighter\nBut the grip of the past holds a little bit tighter\nI'm reminded Your grace never asks for perfection\nOh I'm restored 'cause I'm Yours and I stand forgiven\n\n[Chorus]\nEven when it feels like my world is shaken\nEven when I've had all that I can take\nI know\nYou never let me go\nAnd even when the waters won't stop rising\nEven when I'm caught in the dead of a night\nI know\nNo matter how it ends\nYou're with me even then\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd even in the middle of a struggle\nAnd even when it's hard to remember\nYou alone are my defense when\nI'm standing on Your promises and I know\nThat even in the thick of the battle\nAnd even through the valley of the shadows\nYou alone are my defense when\nI'm standing on Your promises\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhere could I run to?\nWhere could I go?\n\n[Chorus]\nEven when it feels like my world is shaken\nEven when I've had all that I can take\nI know\nYou never let me go\nAnd even when the waters won't stop rising\nEven when I'm caught in the dead of a night\nI know\nNo matter how it ends\nYou're with me even then...\n\n[Outro]\nYou're with me, yeah\nNo matter how it ends\nYou're with me even then\n\n"}
