{"song": "Every Which Way But Loose", "artist": "Eddie Rabbitt", "lyrics": "\n\nI've always been the kind of man\nWho doesn't believe in strings\nLong term obligations are just unnecessary things\nBut girl, ya got me thinkin\nWhile I'm drinkin one more beer\nIf I'm headed for a heartache\nThen why the hell am I still here\n\nI'm testin my resistance\nAnd it's wearin mighty thin\nI've got the feelin I should leave\nBefore the roof caves in\nMy mind tells me to move along\nBut my body begs me stay\nAnd now I feel the need to hold you close\nAnd love the night away\nWhile you're turnin me\n\n[Chorus: ]\nEvery which way but loose\nYou turn me\nEvery which way but loose\nInside the fire's burnin me\nIn my mind you just keep turnin me\nEvery which but loose\nBaby there's no excuse\nTo turn me every which way but loose\n\nWhen the sun comes up in the mornin\nIt should find me some place new\nBut right this minute all I want\nIs to lay here next to you\nThose memories still keep callin me\nFrom somewhere in my past\nBetter hurry if they want me\nCause I can feel me fadin fast\nWhile you're turnin me\n\n"}
