{"song": "Achy Breaky Heart", "artist": "Billy Ray Cyrus", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou can tell the world you never was my girl\nYou can burn my clothes when I'm gone\nOr you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been\nAnd laugh and joke about me on the phone\nYou can tell my arms go back to the farm\nYou can tell my feet to hit the floor\nOr you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips\nThey won't be reaching out for you no more\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nI just don't think he'd understand\nAnd if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nHe might blow up and kill this man, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas\nYou can tell your dog to bite my leg\nOr tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip\nHe never really liked me anyway\nOr tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please\nMyself already knows I'm not okay\nOr you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind\nIt might be walking out on me today\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nI just don't think he'd understand\nAnd if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nHe might blow up and kill this man, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nI just don't think he'd understand\nAnd if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nHe might blow up and kill this man\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nI just don't think he'd understand\nAnd if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart\nHe might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh\n\n"}
