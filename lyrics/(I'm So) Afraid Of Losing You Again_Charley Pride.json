{"song": "(I'm So) Afraid Of Losing You Again", "artist": "Charley Pride", "lyrics": "\n\nSometimes I want to throw my arms around you\nThen I tremble at the thought of giving in\nBecause I know how much it cost to love you\nAnd I'm so afraid of losing you again\n\nBeing close to you revives the sorrow\nThat wakes me up and tells me I can't win\nI'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow\nBut I'm so afraid of losing you again\n\nIf heaven were to hear my heart's confession\nWanting you would be my greatest sin\nBut I'm glad that you're no longer my possession\nCause I'm so afraid of losing you again\n\nBeing close to you revives the sorrow\nThat wakes me up and tells me I can't win\nI'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow\nBut I'm so afraid of losing you again\n\nBeing close to you revives the sorrow\nThat wakes me up and tells me I can't win\nI'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow\nBut I'm so afraid of losing you again\nBut I'm so afraid of losing you again....\n\n"}
