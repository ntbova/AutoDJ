{"song": "Waiting On The World To Change", "artist": "John Mayer", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nMe and all my friends\nWe're all misunderstood\nThey say we stand for nothing and\nThere's no way we ever could\nNow we see everything that's going wrong\nWith the world and those who lead it\nWe just feel like we don't have the means\nTo rise above and beat it\n\n[Chorus]\nSo we keep waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nWe keep on waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nIt's hard to beat the system\nWhen we're standing at a distance\nSo we keep waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow if we had the power\nTo bring our neighbors home from war\nThey would have never missed a Christmas\nNo more ribbons on their door\nBut when you trust your television\nWhat you get is what you got\nBecause when they own the information, oh\nThey can bend it all they want\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why we're waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nWe keep on waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nIt's not that we don't care\nWe just know that the fight isn't fair\nSo we keep on waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we're still waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nWe keep on waiting, waiting on the world to change\nOne day our generation\nIs going to rule the population\nSo we keep on waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\n\n[Outro]\nNow we keep on waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nWe keep on waiting\nWaiting on the world to change\nWaiting on the world to change\nWaiting on the world to change\nWaiting on the world to change\n\n"}
