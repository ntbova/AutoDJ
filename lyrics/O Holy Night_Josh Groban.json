{"song": "O Holy Night", "artist": "Josh Groban", "lyrics": "\n\nO holy night!\nThe stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night\nOf the dear Savior's birth!\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\nTill he appear'd and the soul felt His worth\n\n\nA thrill of hope\nThe weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks\nA new and glorious morn!\n\nFall on your knees\nOh hear the angel voices\nOh night divine\nOh night when Christ was born\nOh night divine, oh night, oh night divine\n\nChains shall He break\nFor the slave is our brother\nAnd in His name all oppression shall cease\n\nSweet hymns of joy\nIn grateful chorus raise we\nLet all within us praise His holy name\n\nChrist is the Lord, let ever ever praise Thee\nNo\u00ebl, No\u00ebl\nOh night, Oh night divine\nNo\u00ebl, No\u00ebl\nOh night, Oh night divine\n\nNo\u00ebl, No\u00ebl\nOh, oh night, oh night divine\n\n"}
