{"song": "(There's No Place Like) Home For The Holidays", "artist": "Perry Como", "lyrics": "\n\nOh, there's no place like home for the holidays\nCause no matter how far away you roam\nWhen you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze\nFor the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home\nI met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was headin' for\nPennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie\nFrom Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down to Dixie's sunny shore\nFrom Atlantic to Pacific, gee, the traffic is terrific\nOh, there's no place like home for the holidays\nCause no matter how far away you roam\nIf you want to be happy in a million ways\nFor the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home\n(Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays)\n(When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze\nI met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was headin' for\nPennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie\nFrom Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down to Dixie's sunny shore\nFrom Atlantic to Pacific, gee, the traffic is terrific\nOh, there's no place like home for the holidays\nCause no matter how far away you roam\nIf you want to be happy in a million ways\nFor the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home\nFor the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home\n\n"}
