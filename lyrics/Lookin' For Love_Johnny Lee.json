{"song": "Lookin' For Love", "artist": "Johnny Lee", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell I spent a lifetime looking for you\nSingle bars and good time lovers were never true\nPlaying a fool's game\nHoping to win\nAnd telling those sweet lies and losing again\n\n[Chorus]\nI was lookin' for love in all the wrong places\nLookin' for love in too many faces\nSearchin' their eyes\nLookin' for traces\nOf what I'm dreamin' of\nHoping to find a friend and a lover\nI'll bless the day I discover\nAnother heart lookin' for love\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I was alone then\nNo love in sight\nI did every thing I could to get me through the night\nDon't know where it started\nOr where it might end\nI'd turn to a stranger just like a friend\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places\nLookin' for love in too many faces\nSearchin' their eyes\nLookin' for traces\nOf what I'm dreamin' of\nHoping to find a friend and a lover\nI'll bless the day I discover\nAnother heart lookin' for love\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd you came a knockin'\nAt my heart's door\nYou're everything I've been lookin' forrrrrrrr\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's no more lookin' for love in all the wrong places\nLookin' for love in too many faces\nSearchin' their eyes\nLookin' for traces\nOf what I'm dreamin' of\nNow that I've found a friend and a lover\nGod bless the day I discovered\nYou\nOh, you, lookin' for love\n\n[Outro]\nLookin' for love in all the wrong places\nLookin' for love in too many faces\nSearchin' their eyes\nLookin' for traces\nOf what I'm dreamin' of\nNow that I've found a friend and a lover\nGod bless the day I discovered\nYou\nOh, you, lookin' for love\nLookin' for love in all the wrong places\nLookin' for love in too many faces\nSearchin' their eyes\nLookin' for traces\nOf what I'm dreamin' of\nNow that I've found a friend and a lover\nGod bless the day I discovered\nYou\nOh, you, lookin' for love\n\n"}
