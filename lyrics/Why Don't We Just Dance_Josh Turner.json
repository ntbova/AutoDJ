{"song": "Why Don't We Just Dance", "artist": "Josh Turner", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nBaby why don't we just turn that TV off?\nThree hundred fifteen channels\nOf nothing but bad news on\nWell, it might be me, but the way I see it\nThe whole wide world has gone crazy\nSo baby, why don't we just dance?\nGuess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much\nWhen the lights go down and we move the couch\nIt's going to be more than enough\nFor my two left feet and our two hearts beating\nNobody's going to see us go crazy\nSo baby, why don't we just dance?\n\n[Chorus]\nDown the hall, maybe straight up the stairs\nBouncing off the wall, floating on air\nBaby, why don't we just dance?\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby, why don't you go put your best dress on?\nThose high heeled shoes you love to lose\nAs soon as the tunes come on\nOn second thought, just the way you are\nIs already driving me crazy\nSo baby, why don't we just dance?\n\n[Chorus]\nDown the hall, maybe straight up the stairs\nBouncing off the wall, floating on air\nBaby, why don't we just dance?\n\n[Outro]\nWell it might be me but the way I see it\nThe whole wide world has gone crazy\nSo baby, why don't we just dance?\nOh baby, why don't we just dance?\n\n"}
