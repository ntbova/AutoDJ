I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet him know that you know best\n'Cause after all, you do know best\nTry to slip past his defense\nWithout granting innocence\nLay down a list of what is wrong\nThe things you've told him all along\nAnd pray to God he hears you\nAnd pray to God he hears you, and\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\n[Verse 3]\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr break with the ones you've followed\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\n"}
