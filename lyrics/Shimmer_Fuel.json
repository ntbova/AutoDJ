{"song": "Shimmer", "artist": "Fuel", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe calls me from the cold\nJust when I was low, feeling short of stable\nAnd all that she intends\nAnd all she keeps inside, isn't on the label\nShe says she's ashamed\nCan she take me for a while?\nAnd can I be a friend?\nWe'll forget the past\nOr maybe I'm not able\nAnd I break at the bend\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're here and now\nWill we ever be again?\nCause I have found\nAll that shimmers in this world is sure to fade\nAway again\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe dreams a champagne dream\nStrawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper\nLavender and cream\nFields of butterflies, reality escapes her\nShe says that love is for fools who fall behind\nAnd I'm somewhere between\nI never really know\nA killer from a savior\n'Til I break at the bend\n\n[Chorus}\nWe're here and now\nWill we ever be again?\nCause I have found\nAll that shimmers in this world is sure to fade\nAway again\n\n[Outro]\nIt's too far away for me to hold\nIt's too far away\nIt's too far away for me to hold\nIt's too far away\nAh oh\n\nYeah, it's too far away for me to hold\nIt's too far away\nAh ah oh\nIt's too far away for me to hold\nIt's too far away\nIt's too far away for me to hold\nIt's too far away\nAh ah oh\nIt's too far away for me to hold\nIt's too far away\nGuess I'll let it go\n\n"}
