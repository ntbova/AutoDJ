{"song": "My Heart Skips A Beat", "artist": "Buck Owens", "lyrics": "\n\nOh, my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street\nI feel a trembling in my knees\nAnd just to know you're mine until the end of time\nMakes my heart skip a beat\n\nWell, I did a double take the day I met you\nMy heart turned a flip as I stood next to you\nAnd I knew right there I never could forget you\nFor you are my every dream come true\n\nAnd my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street\nI feel a trembling in my knees\nAnd just to know you're mine until the end of time\nMakes my heart skip a beat\n\nYou came into my life without a warning\nAnd you turned my cloudy skies from gray to blue\nYou're my sunshine that comes up every morning\nYes you are my every dream come true\n\nAnd my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street\nI feel a trembling in my knees\nAnd just to know you're mine until the end of time\nMakes my heart skip a beat\n\n"}
