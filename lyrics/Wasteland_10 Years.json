{"song": "Wasteland", "artist": "10 Years", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\n\n[Verse 1]\nCrouched over, you were not there, living in fear\nBut signs were not really that scarce, obvious tears\nBut I will not hide you through this, I want you to help them\nPlease see the bleeding heart perched on my shirt\nDie, withdraw, hide in cold sweat, quivering lips\nIgnore remorse, naming a kid, living wasteland\nThis time you've tried all that you can, turning you red\n\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nShould I? Could I?\nHere we are with your obsession\nShould I? Could I?\n\n[Verse 2]\nCrowned, hopeless, the article read, \"living wasteland\"\nThis time you've tried all that you can, turning you red\nBut I will not hide you through this, I want you to help\n\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nShould I? Could I?\nHere we are with your obsession\nShould I? Could I?\n\n[Bridge]\nHeave the silver, hollow sliver\nPiercing through another victim\nTurn and tremble, be judgmental\nIgnorant to all the symbols\nBlind the face with beauty paste\nEventually, you'll one day know\n\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nLimbs tied, skin tight\nSelf inflicted his perdition\nShould I? Could I?\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nShould I? Could I?\n\n[Outro (Only in the 2005 version)]\nShould I? Could I?\n\n"}
