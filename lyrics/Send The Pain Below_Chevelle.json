{"song": "Send The Pain Below", "artist": "Chevelle", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI liked having hurt\nSo send the pain below, where I need it\nYou used to beg me to take care of things\nAnd smile at the thought of me failing\nBut long before having hurt\nI'd send the pain below\nI'd send the pain below\n\n[Chorus]\nMuch like suffocating\nMuch like suffocating\nMuch like suffocating\n(I'd send the pain below)\nMuch like suffocating\n(I'd send the pain below)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou used to run me away\nAll while laughing\nThen cry about that fact\n'Til I returned\nBut long before having hurt\nI'd send the pain below\nI'd send the pain below\n\n[Chorus]\nMuch like suffocating\nMuch like suffocating\nMuch like suffocating\n(I'd send the pain below)\nMuch like suffocating\n(I'd send the pain below)\nMuch like suffocating\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't feel my chest\nNeed more\nDrop down\nClosing in\nI can't feel my chest\nDrop down\n\n[Chorus]\nI liked having hurt\nSo send the pain below\nSo send the pain below\n(Much like suffocating)\nI liked\nSo send the pain below\n(Much like suffocating)\nHaving hurt\nSo send the pain below\n(Much like suffocating)\nSo send the pain below\n(Much like suffocating)\nSo send the pain below\n\n"}
