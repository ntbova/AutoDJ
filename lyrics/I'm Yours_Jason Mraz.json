{"song": "I'm Yours", "artist": "Jason Mraz", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell you done done me in, you bet I felt it\nI tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted\nI fell right through the cracks\nAnd now I'm trying to get back\nBefore the cool done run out\nI'll be giving it my bestest\nAnd nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention\nI reckon it's again my turn, to win some or learn some\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I won't hesitate no more, no more\nIt cannot wait, I'm yours\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell open up your mind and see like me\nOpen up your plans and, damn, you're free\nLook into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love\nListen to the music of the moment people dance and sing\nWe're just one big family\nAnd it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I won't hesitate no more, no more\nIt cannot wait, I'm sure\nThere's no need to complicate\nOur time is short\nThis is our fate, I'm yours\nBut do, do, do, do you, but do you, do, do, do you, but do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear\nAnd I will nibble your ear\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror\nAnd bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer\nBut my breath fogged up the glass\nAnd so I drew a new face and I laughed\nI guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason\nTo rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons\nIt's what we aim to do\nOur name is our virtue\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I won't hesitate no more, no more\nIt cannot wait, I'm yours\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell open up your mind and see like me\nOpen up your plans and, damn, you're free\nLook into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours\nSo please don't, please don't, please don't\nThere's no need to complicate\n'Cause our time is short\nThis oh, this oh, this is our fate\nI'm yours\n\n[Outro]\n(Scat Ad-lib)\n\n"}
