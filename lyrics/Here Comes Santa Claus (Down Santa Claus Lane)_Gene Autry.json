{"song": "Here Comes Santa Claus (Down Santa Claus Lane)", "artist": "Gene Autry", "lyrics": "\n\nHere comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane\nVixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins\nBells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright\nSo hang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight\n\nHere comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane\nHe's got a bag that's filled with toys for boys and girls again\nHear those sleigh bells jingle jangle, oh what a beautiful sight\nSo jump in bed and cover your head, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight\n\nHere comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane\nHe doesn't care if you're rich or poor, he loves you just the same\nSanta Claus knows we're all God's children, that makes everything right\nSo fill your hearts with Christmas cheer, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight\n\nHere comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane\nHe'll come around when chimes ring out that it's Christmas morn' again\nPeace on Earth will come to all if we just follow the light\nSo let's give thanks to the lord above, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight\n\nHere comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane\nVixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins\nBells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright\nHang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight\n\n"}
