(woah, oh yeah)\n\n[Bridge: Jack Avery]\nWhen I close my eyes\nIt's you there in my mind\nWhen I close my eyes\n\n[Chorus: Corbyn Besson & Jack Avery]\nIf all it is is eight letters\nWhy is it so hard to say?\nIf all it is is eight letters\nWhy am I in my own way?\nWhy do I pull you close\nAnd then ask you for space\nIf all it is is eight letters\nWhy is it so hard to say?\n\n[Outro: Corbyn Besson & Jack Avery & Daniel Seavey]\nIf all it is is eight letters\nWhen I close my eyes\nIt's you there in my mind  (It's only you)\nWhen I close my eyes\nIf all it is is eight letters\nWhen I close my eyes\nIt's you there in my mind (you)\nWhen I close my eyes\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\n"}
