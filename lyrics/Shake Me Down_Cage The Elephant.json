{"song": "Shake Me Down", "artist": "Cage The Elephant", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nShake me down, not a lot of people left around\nWho knows now? Softly laying on the ground\nOooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn my life I have seen people walk into the sea\nJust to find memories plagued by constant misery\nTheir eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground\nTheir eyes cast down\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun\n\n[Verse 3]\nShake me down, cut my hair on a silver cloud\nBroken sound, softly laying on the ground\nOooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh\n\n[Verse 4]\nIn my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets\nTaste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed\nWith eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun\nTurn back now, it's time for me to let go\nWay down, had to find a place to lay low\nLamp shade, turned around into a light post\n\n[Bridge]\nWalk around the corner, never saw it coming, still\nI try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief\nI don't want to know the future, I'm like Rolling Thunder\nEven on a cloudy day\nEven on a cloudy day\nEven on a cloudy day\nEven on a cloudy day\nEven on a cloudy day\nEven on a cloudy day\nEven on a cloudy day\n\n[Chorus 3]\nI'll keep my eyes fixed on the-\nI'll keep my eyes fixed on the-\nI'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun\n\n[Outro]\nShake me down, not a lot of people left around\nOooh oooh\n\n"}
