{"song": "Hallelujah", "artist": "Pentatonix", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1: Scott]\nI\u2019ve heard there was a secret chord\nThat David played and it pleased the Lord\nBut you don't really care for music, do you?\nWell it goes like this\nThe fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\n\n[Verse 2: Avi]\nWell, your faith was strong but you needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya\nShe tied you to the kitchen chair\nShe broke your throne and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\n\n[Verse 3: Kirstin]\nWell baby I've been here before\nI've seen this room and I've walked this floor\nI used to live alone before I knew ya\nAnd I've seen your flag on the marble arch\nAnd love is not a vict'ry march\nIt's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\n\n[Verse 4: Mitch]\nWell, maybe there\u2019s a God above\nBut all I\u2019ve ever learned from love\nWas how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya\nAnd it\u2019s not a cry that you hear at night\nIt\u2019s not somebody who's seen the light\nIt\u2019s a cold and it\u2019s a broken Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\n\n[Outro]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\n\n"}
