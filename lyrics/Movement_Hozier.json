{"song": "Movement", "artist": "Hozier", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI still watch you when you're groovin'\nAs if through water from the bottom of a pool\nYou're movin' without movin'\nAnd when you move, I'm moved\nYou are a call to motion\nThere, all of you a verb in perfect view\nLike Jonah on the ocean\nWhen you move, I'm moved\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you move\nI'm put to mind of all that I wanna be\nWhen you move\nI could never define all that you are to me\n\n[Chorus]\nSo move me, baby\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\nYou do it naturally\nMove me, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou are the rite of movement\nIts reasonin' made lucid and cool\nI know it's no improvement\nWhen you move, I move\nYou're S. Polunin leapin'\nOr Fred Astaire in sequins\nHoney, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'\nAnd when you move, I'm moved\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen you move\nI can recall somethin' that's gone from me\nWhen you move\nHoney, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free\n\n[Chorus]\nSo move me, baby\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\nYou do it naturally\nMove me, baby\nSo move me, baby\nLike you've nothin' left to prove\nAnd nothin' to lose\nMove me, baby\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOh baby, oh baby\nMove like grey skies\nMove like a bird of paradise\nMove like an odd sight come out at night\n\n[Chorus]\nMove me, baby\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\nYou do it naturally\nMove me, baby\nSo move me, baby\nLike you've nothin' left to lose\nAnd nothin' to prove\nMove me, baby\nSo move me, baby\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\nYou do it naturally\nMove me, baby\n\n"}
