{"song": "The Diary Of Jane", "artist": "Breaking Benjamin", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf I had to, I would put myself right beside you\nSo let me ask, \"Would you like that? Would you like that?\"\nAnd I don't mind if you say this love is the last time\nSo now I'll ask, \"Do you like that? Do you like that?\" \u2013 no!\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething's getting in the way\nSomething's just about to break\nI will try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nSo tell me how it should be\n\n[Verse 2]\nTry to find out what makes you tick\nAs I lie down, sore and sick\nDo you like that, do you like that?\nThere's a fine line between love and hate\nAnd I don't mind, just let me say\nThat I like that, I like that\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething's getting in the way\nSomething's just about to break\nI will try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nAs I burn another page, as I look the other way\nI still try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nSo tell me how it should be\n\n[Bridge]\nDesperate, I will crawl\nWaiting for so long\nNo love, there is no love\nDie for anyone\nWhat have I become?\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething's getting in the way\nSomething's just about to break\nI will try to find my place in the diary of Jane\nAs I burn another page, as I look the other way\nI still try to find my place in the diary of Jane\n\n"}
