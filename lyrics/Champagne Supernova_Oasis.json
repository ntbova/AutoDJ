{"song": "Champagne Supernova", "artist": "Oasis", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow many special people change?\nHow many lives are living strange?\nWhere were you while we were getting high?\n\nSlowly walking down the hall\nFaster than a cannonball\nWhere were you while we were getting high?\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday you will find me\nCaught beneath the landslide\nIn a champagne supernova in the sky\nSomeday you will find me\nCaught beneath the landslide\nIn a champagne supernova\nA champagne supernova in the sky\n\n[Verse 2]\nWake up the dawn and ask her why\nA dreamer dreams she never dies\nWipe that tear away now from your eye\n\nSlowly walking down the hall\nFaster than a cannonball\nWhere were you while we were getting high?\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday you will find me\nCaught beneath the landslide\nIn a champagne supernova in the sky\nSomeday you will find me\nCaught beneath the landslide\nIn a champagne supernova\nA champagne supernova\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause people believe\nThat they're gonna get away for the summer\nBut you and I, we live and die\nThe world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why\nWhy? Why? Why? Why?\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow many special people change?\nHow many lives are living strange?\nWhere were you while we were getting high?\n\nSlowly walking down the hall\nFaster than a cannonball\nWhere were you while we were getting high?\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday you will find me\nCaught beneath the landslide\nIn a champagne supernova in the sky\nSomeday you will find me\nCaught beneath the landslide\nIn a champagne supernova\nA champagne supernova\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause people believe\nThat they're gonna get away for the summer\nBut you and I, we live and die\nThe world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why\nWhy? Why? Why? Why?\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nHow many special people change?\nHow many lives are living strange?\nWhere were you while we were getting high?\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\nWe were getting high\n\n"}
