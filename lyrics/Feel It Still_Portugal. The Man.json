The Man", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan't keep my hands to myself\nThink I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf\nIn case my little baby girl is in need\nAm I coming out of left field?\n\n[Chorus 1]\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now\nI been feeling it since 1966, now\nMight be over now, but I feel it still\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now\nLet me kick it like it's 1986, now\nMight be over now, but I feel it still\n\n[Verse 2]\nGot another mouth to feed\nLeave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger\nGone with the fallen leaves\nAm I coming out of left field?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now\nI been feeling it since 1966, now\nMight've had your fill, but you feel it still\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now\nLet me kick it like it's 1986, now\nMight be over now, but I feel it still\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe could fight a war for peace\n(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)\nGive in to that easy living\nGoodbye to my hopes and dreams\nStart flipping for my enemies\nWe could wait until the walls come down\n(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)\nIt's time to give a little to the kids in the middle\nBut, oh until it falls won't bother me\n\n[Bridge]\nIs it coming?\nIs it coming?\nIs it coming?\nIs it coming?\nIs it coming?\nIs it coming back?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah\nYour love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now\nMight be over now, but I feel it still\n\n[Chorus 3]\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now\nI've been feeling it since 1966, now\nMight be over now, but I feel it still\nOoh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now\nLet me kick it like it's 1986, now\nMight be over now, but I feel it still\nMight've had your fill, but I feel it still\n\n"}
