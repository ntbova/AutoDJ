{"song": "Rhinestone Cowboy", "artist": "Glen Campbell", "lyrics": "\n\nI've been walkin' these streets so long\nSingin' the same old song\nI know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway\nWhere hustle's the name of the game\nAnd nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain\nThere's been a load of compromisin'\nOn the road to my horizon\nBut I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\nRiding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\nGetting cards and letters from people I don't even know\nAnd offers comin' over the phone\n\nWell, I really don't mind the rain\nAnd a smile can hide all the pain\nBut you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way\nAnd I dream of the things I'll do\nWith a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe\nThere'll be a load of compromisin'\nOn the road to my horizon\nBut I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\nRiding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo\nRhinestone cowboy\nGettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know\nAnd offers comin' over the phone\n\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\nRiding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo\n\n[Fade]\nLike a rhinestone cowboy\nGettin' card and letters from people I don't even know\n\n"}
