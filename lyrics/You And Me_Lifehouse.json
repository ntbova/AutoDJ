And in what month?\nThis clock never seemed so alive\nI can't keep up and I can't back down\nI've been losing so much time\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to lose\nAnd it's you and me and all other people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right\nI'm tripping on words\nYou've got my head spinning\nI don't know where to go from here\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to prove\nAnd it's you and me and all other people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's something about you now\nI can't quite figure out\nEverything she does is beautiful\nEverything she does is right\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do\nNothing to lose\nAnd it's you and me and all other people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\nAnd me and all other people with nothing to do\nNothing to prove\nAnd it's you and me and all other people\nAnd I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you\n\n[Outro/Verse 1]\nWhat day is it? And in what month?\nThis clock never seemed so alive\n\n"}
