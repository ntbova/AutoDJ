{"song": "If You Leave Me Tonight I'Ll Cry", "artist": "Jerry Wallace", "lyrics": "\n\n(If you leave, take my heart, take my heart)\nIf you leave me tonight I will cry\nThough you say we will soon meet again\nFor the hours I've spent here with you\nAre like words from a poet's pen\n\n[Chorus:]\nWords like love, and truth, and goodness\nWords like Until death us do part\nI will never love another\nTake my heart, take my heart, take my heart\n(Take my heart)\n\nYes, the hours I've spent here with you\nAre like words from a poet's pen\n\n[Chorus]\nTake my heart, take my heart, take my heart\n(Take my heart)\n\n"}
