{"song": "Burden In My Hand", "artist": "Soundgarden", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nFollow me into the desert\nAs thirsty as you are\nCrack a smile and cut your mouth\nAnd drown in alcohol\nCause down below the truth is lying\nBeneath the riverbed\nSo quench yourself and drink the water\nThat flows below her head\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh no, there she goes\nOut in the sunshine\nThe sun is mine\nThe sun is mine\n\n[Chorus]\nI shot my love today, would you cry for me\nI lost my head again, would you lie for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nClose your eyes and bow your head\nI need a little sympathy\nCause fear is strong and love's for everyone\nWho isn't me\nSo kill your health and kill yourself\nAnd kill everything you love\nAnd if you live you can fall to pieces\nAnd suffer with my ghost\n\n[Chorus]\nI shot my love today, would you cry for me\nI lost my head again, would you lie for me\nI left her in the sand just a burden in my hand\nI lost my head again, would you cry for me\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's just a burden in my hand\nIt's just an anchor on my heart\nIt's just a tumour in my head\nAnd I'm in the dark\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo follow me into the desert\nAs desperate as you are\nWhere the moon is glued to a picture of heaven\nAnd all the little pigs have God\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh no, there she goes\nOut in the sunshine\nThe sun is mine\nThe sun is mine\n\n[Chorus]\nI shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah\nI lost my head again, would you lie for me\nI left her in the sand just a burden in my hand\nI lost my head again, would you cry for me\nYeah, would you cry for me\n\n"}
