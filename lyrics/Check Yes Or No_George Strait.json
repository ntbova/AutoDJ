{"song": "Check Yes Or No", "artist": "George Strait", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt started way back in third grade\nI used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes\nA pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail\nShe kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell\n\n[Verse 2]\nNext day I chased her 'round the playground\nAcross the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round\nAnd Emmylou got caught passing me a note\nBefore the teacher took it, I read what she wrote\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?\nAnd if you do\nWell then don't be afraid to take me by the hand\nIf you want to\nI think this is how love goes, check yes or no\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow we're grown up and she's my wife\nStill like two kids with stars in our eyes\nAin't much changed, I still chase Emmylou\nUp and down the hall, around the bed in our room\n\n[Verse 4]\nLast night I took her out in a white limousine\nTwenty years together, she still gets to me\nCan't believe it's been that long ago\nWhen we got started with just a little note\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?\nAnd if you do\nWell then don't be afraid to take me by the hand\nIf you want to\nI think this is how love goes, check yes or no\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?\nAnd if you do\nWell then don't be afraid to take me by the hand\nIf you want to\nI think this is how love goes, check yes or no\"\n\n[Outro]\nCheck yes or no\nCheck yes or no\nCheck yes or no\nCheck yes or no\n\n"}
