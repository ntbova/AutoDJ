{"song": "Waiting For A Girl Like You", "artist": "Foreigner", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo long, i've been looking too hard, I've waiting too long\nSometimes I don't know what I will find\nI only know it's a matter of time\nWhen you love someone\nWhen you love someone\nIt feels so right, so warm and true\nI need to know if you feel it too\nMaybe I'm wrong\nWon't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?\nThis heart of mine has been hurt before\nThis time I want to be sure\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been waiting for a girl like you\nTo come into my life\nI've been waiting for a girl like you\nA love that will survive\nI've been waiting for someone new\nTo make me feel alive\nYeah, waiting for a girl like you\nTo come into my life\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're so good\nWhen we make love it's understood\nIt's more than a touch or a word we say\nOnly in dreams could it be this way\nWhen you love someone\nYeah, really love someone\nNow, I know it's right\nFrom the moment I wake up till deep in the night\nThere's no where on earth that I'd rather be\nThan holding you, tenderly\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been waiting for a girl like you\nTo come into my life\nI've been waiting for a girl like you\nA love that will survive\nI've been waiting for someone new\nTo make me feel alive\nYeah, waiting for a girl like you\nTo come into my life\nI've been waiting for a girl like you\nTo come into my life\nI've been waiting for a girl like you\nA love that will survive\nI've been waiting for someone new\nTo make me feel alive\nYeah, waiting for a girl like you\nTo come into my life\n\n[Outro]\nWon't you come into my life?\nMy life?\n\n"}
