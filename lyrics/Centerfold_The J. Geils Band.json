Does she talk?\nDoes she come complete?\nMy homeroom homeroom angel\nAlways pulled me from my seat\n\nShe was pure like snowflakes\nNo one could ever stain\nThe memory of my angel\nCould never cause me pain\n\nYears go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine\nAnd there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between\n\n[Chorus]\n\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\nSlipped me notes under the desk\nWhile I was thinkin' about her dress\nI was shy I turned away\nBefore she caught my eye\n\nI was shakin' in my shoes\nWhenever she flashed those baby-blues\nSomething had a hold on me\nWhen angel passed close by\n\nThose soft and fuzzy sweaters\nToo magical to touch\nTo see her in that negligee\nIs really just too much\n\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\nNah nah nah nah nah nah\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\n\nIt's okay I understand\nThis ain't no never-never land\nI hope that when this issue's gone\nI'll see you when your clothes are on\n\nTake you car, Yes we will\nWe'll take your car and drive it\nWe'll take it to a motel room\nAnd take 'em off in private\n\nA part of me has just been ripped\nThe pages from my mind are stripped\nOh no, I can't deny it\nOh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!\n\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\nNah nah nah nah nah nah\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\nNah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah\n\n{Outro}\nMy blood runs cold\nMy memory has just been sold\nMy angel is the centerfold\nAngel is the centerfold\n\n"}
