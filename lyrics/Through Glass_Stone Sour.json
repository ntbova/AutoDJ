{"song": "Through Glass", "artist": "Stone Sour", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nI'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nOh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you\nThat forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow do you feel? That is the question\nBut I forget you don't expect an easy answer\nWhen something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up\nLike paper dolls and little notes, you can\u2019t expect a bit of hope\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSo while you\u2019re outside looking in, describing what you see\nRemember what you\u2019re staring at is me\n\n[Chorus]\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m looking at you through the glass\nDon\u2019t know how much time has passed\nAll I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you\nThat forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow much is real? So much to question\nAn epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything\nWe thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start\nJust listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBefore you tell yourself, it's just a different scene\nRemember it's just different from what you've seen\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAnd all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you\nThat forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAnd all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you\nThat forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat shine for you\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat lie to you, yeah-ah\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nOh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you\nThat forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass\nDon't know how much time has passed\nAll I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you\nThat forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat shine for you, yeah-ah\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat lie to you, yeah-ah\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat shine for you, yeah-ah\nAnd it's the stars, the stars\nThat lie to you, yeah yeah\n\n[Outro]\nOh and the stars\nOh and the stars, they lie\n\n"}
