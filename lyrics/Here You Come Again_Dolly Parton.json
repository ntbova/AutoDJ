{"song": "Here You Come Again", "artist": "Dolly Parton", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere you come again\nJust when I'd begun to get myself together\nYou waltz right in the door\nJust like you've done before\nAnd wrap my heart 'round your little finger\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere you come again\nJust when I'm about to make it work without you\nYou look into my eyes\nAnd lie those pretty lies\nAnd pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you\n\n[Chorus]\nAll you got to do is smile that smile\nAnd there go all my defenses\nJust leave it up to you and in a little while\nYou're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere you come again\nLooking' better than a body has a right to\nAnd shaking' me up so that all I really know\nIs here you come again\nAnd here I go\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nAll you got to do is smile that smile\nAnd there go all my defenses\nJust leave it up to you and in a little while\nYou're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses\n\n[Verse 4]\nHere you come again\nLooking' better than a body has a right to\nAnd shaking' me up so\nThat all I really know\nIs here you come again\nAnd here I go\nHere I go\nAnd here I go\nAnd here I go\nHere you come again\nAnd here I go\nHere I go\nAnd here I go\nHere I go\n\n"}
