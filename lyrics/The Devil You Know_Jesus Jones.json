{"song": "The Devil You Know", "artist": "Jesus Jones", "lyrics": "\n\nA life to call our own\nThat is ours alone\nIs as hard as hell to come by these days\nTime that I took what's mine, took it now\nThings aren't what they where, they're what they are\nThere's no time of our own\nAnd the devil you know is the only one\nIs time too fast for us to grasp something of our own?\nThe ghost of the past has its arms around me\nIt moves everywhere in all I hear and see\nAnd the devil you know is the only one\nLook at you now, look at you then, see how you will be\nAll of your life belongs to me\nThings aren't what they where, they're what they are\nThere's no time of our own\nAnd the devil you know is the only one\n\n"}
