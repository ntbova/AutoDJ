{"song": "Hey Larocco", "artist": "Rayland Baxter", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI don't wanna go outside\nTonight I wanna kill some time\nUnlike every time I've done before\nOn a clear day you might see me\nIn a cage on a yellow brick road\nWishing I had someone to adore\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, the trouble I can find in Baltimore\nDon't let me die behind this iron door\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Larocco\nWhy'd you rat me out?\nNow I'm in trouble\nDon't you fail me now\nI'm the only ace around\nI know you wanna bring me down\nHey Larocco\n\n[Verse 2]\nI believe it was a Friday night\nCharlie Avenue bowl fight\nA lightning bolt light to Mike Larocco's head\nHe was angry at a friend of mine\nI'm a saviour when I have the time\nBut Jesus freaks, they taught me everything\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I swear to God, he died there in the street\nNow this iron door is closing down on me\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Larocco\nWhy'd you rat me out?\nNow I'm in trouble\nDon't you fail me now\nI'm the only ace around\nI know you wanna bring me down\nHey Larocco\n\n[Bridge]\nI bet you and your mama think\nI got a big gold rock in the bank\nBut just because I dress like them\nIt don't mean I was made of millions\nWhat about the little kid I was saving?\nHe was the one misbehaving\nAnd now I lay on the floor\nBehind the nine foot iron door\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Larocco\nWhy'd you rat me out?\nNow I'm in trouble\nBut please brother, don't you fail me now\nHey Larocco\nWhy'd you rat me out?\nNow I'm in trouble\nBut don't you fail me now\nI'm the only ace around\nI know you wanna bring me down\nHey Larocco\nHey Larocco\nHey Larocco\nOh, hey Larocco\nOh, hey Larocco\n\n"}
