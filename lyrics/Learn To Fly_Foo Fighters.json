{"song": "Learn To Fly", "artist": "Foo Fighters", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nRun and tell all of the angels\nThis could take all night\nThink I need a devil to help me get things right\nHook me up a new revolution\nCause this one is a lie\nWe sat around laughing and watched the last one die\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm looking to the sky to save me\nLooking for a sign of life\nLooking for something to help me burn out bright\nI'm looking for a complication\nLooking cause I'm tired of lying\nMake my way back home when I learn to fly high\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think I'm done nursing the patience\nIt can wait one night\nI'd give it all away if you give me one last try\nWe'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life\nRun and tell the angels that everything's alright\n\n[Chorus 2]\nNow I'm looking to the sky to save me\nLooking for a sign of life\nLooking for something to help me burn out bright\nI'm looking for a complication\nLooking cause I'm tired of trying\nMake my way back home when I learn to fly high\nMake my way back home when I learn to...\n\n[Bridge]\nFly along with me, I can't quite make it alone\nTry to make this life my own\nFly along with me, I can't quite make it alone\nTry to make this life my own\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm looking to the sky to save me\nLooking for a sign of life\nLooking for something to help me burn out bright\nI'm looking for a complication\nLooking cause I'm tired of trying\nMake my way back home when I learn to\n\nI'm looking to the sky to save me\nLooking for a sign of life\nLooking for something to help me burn out bright\nI'm looking for a complication\nLooking cause I'm tired of trying\nMake my way back home when I learn to fly high\nMake my way back home when I learn to fly...\nMake my way back home when I learn to...\n\n"}
