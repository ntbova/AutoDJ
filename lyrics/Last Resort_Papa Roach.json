Chances are that I might\nMutilation out of sight\nAnd I'm contemplatin' suicide\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind\nWish somebody would tell me I'm fine\nLosin' my sight, losin' my mind\nWish somebody would tell me I'm fine\n\n[Verse 2]\nI never realized I was spread too thin\nTill it was too late and I was empty within\nHungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin\nDownward spiral, where do I begin?\nIt all started when I lost my mother\nNo love for myself and no love for another\nSearchin' to find a love upon a higher level\nFindin' nothin' but questions and devils\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind\nWish somebody would tell me I'm fine\nLosin' my sight, losin' my mind\nWish somebody would tell me I'm fine\n\n[Bridge]\nNothing's alright, nothing is fine\nI'm runnin' and I'm crying\nI'm crying, I'm crying\nI'm crying, I'm crying\nI can't go on living this way\n\n[Verse 3]\nCut my life into pieces\nThis is my last resort\nSuffocation, no breathing\nDon't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding\nWould it be wrong, would it be right\nIf I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might\nMutilation out of sight\nAnd I'm contemplating suicide\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind\nWish somebody would tell me I'm fine\nLosin' my sight, losin' my mind\nWish somebody would tell me I'm fine\n\n[Outro]\nNothing's alright, nothing is fine\nI'm runnin' and I'm crying\nI can't go on living this way\nCan't go on living this way\nNothing's alright\n\n"}
