Are you pistol whipped?\nWill you step in line or release the glitch?\nCan you fall asleep with a panic switch?\n\nWhen you see yourself in a crowded room\nDo your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?\nWill you step in line or release the glitch?\nDo you think she'll sleep with a panic?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll try to hold on tight tonight\nPink slip inviting me inside\nWant to burn skin and brand what once was mine\nBut the red views keep ripping the divide\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nIf I go everywhere you want me to go\nHow will I know you'll still follow?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you see yourself in a crowded room?\nDo your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?\nWill you step in line or release the glitch?\nCan you fall asleep with a panic switch?\n\nWhen you see yourself in a crowded room\nDo your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?\nWill you step in line or release the glitch?\nDo you think she'll sleep with a panic?\n\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating...\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Bridge 2]\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nI'm waiting and fading and floating away\nWaiting and fading, waiting and fading\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you see yourself in a crowded room?\nDo your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?\nWill you step in line or release the glitch?\nCan you fall asleep with a panic switch?\n\nWhen you see yourself in a crowded room\nDo your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?\nWill you step in line or release the glitch?\nDo you think she'll sleep with a panic?\n\n"}
