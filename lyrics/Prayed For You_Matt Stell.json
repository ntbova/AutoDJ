{"song": "Prayed For You", "artist": "Matt Stell", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've never been one to ask for help\nIf I need a mountain moved, I move it myself\nI ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday\nQuote you the scripture kind\nI'm far from a preacher\nBut I'm a believer\n\n[Chorus 1]\n'Cause every single day, before I knew your name\nI couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you\nEvery heartbreak trail when all hope failed\nOn the highway to hell, I prayed for you\nI kept my faith like that old King James\nSaid I'm supposed to\nIt's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\nI didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor someone to love me like you do\nGraceful eyes to see me through\nA smile that steals me, a heart that heals me\nA touch that kills me too\nBaby you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it\n\n[Chorus 1]\n'Cause every single day, before I knew your name\nI couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you\nEvery heartbreak trail when all hope failed\nOn the highway to hell, I prayed for you\nI kept my faith like that old King James\nSaid I'm supposed to\nIt's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\nI didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you\n\n[Chorus 2]\nEvery single day, before I knew your name\nI couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you\nEvery tail light fade in the goodbye rain\nGirl even today, I prayed for you\nI kept my faith like that old King James\nSaid I'm supposed to\nIt's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\nI didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you\nI prayed for you\nI prayed for you\n\n"}
