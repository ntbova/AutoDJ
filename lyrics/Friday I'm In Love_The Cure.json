{"song": "Friday I'm In Love", "artist": "The Cure", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI don't care if Monday's blue\nTuesday's grey and Wednesday too\nThursday I don't care about you\nIt's Friday, I'm in love\nMonday you can fall apart\nTuesday, Wednesday, break my heart\nThursday doesn't even start\nIt's Friday, I'm in love\n\n[Chorus]\nSaturday, wait\nAnd Sunday always comes too late\nBut Friday, never hesitate\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't care if Monday's black\nTuesday, Wednesday heart attack\nThursday never looking back\nIt's Friday, I'm in love\n\n[Verse 3]\nMonday you can hold your head\nTuesday, Wednesday stay in bed\nOr Thursday watch the walls instead\nIt's Friday, I'm in love\n\n[Chorus]\nSaturday, wait\nAnd Sunday always comes too late\nBut Friday, never hesitate\n\n[Bridge]\nDressed up to the eyes\nIt's a wonderful surprise\nTo see your shoes and your spirits rise\nThrowing out your frown\nAnd just smiling at the sound\nAnd as sleek as a shriek\nSpinning round and round\nAlways take a big bite\nIt's such a gorgeous sight\nTo see you eat in the middle of the night\nYou can never get enough\nEnough of this stuff\nIt's Friday I'm in love\n\n[Verse 4]\nI don't care if Monday's blue\nTuesday's grey and Wednesday too\nThursday I don't care about you\nIt's Friday, I'm in love\nMonday you can fall apart\nTuesday, Wednesday break my heart\nThursday doesn't even start\nIt's Friday, I'm in love\n\n"}
