{"song": "Friends Don't", "artist": "Maddie & Tae", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey don't cancel other plans\nHave conversations with nothing but their eyes\nThey don't hear each other's names and forget to concentrate\nHits a nerve and lights you up like dynamite\n\n[Chorus]\nFriends don't call you in the middle of the night\nCouldn't even tell you why\nThey just felt like saying \"hi\"\nFriends don't stand around, playing with their keys\nFinding reasons not to leave\nTrying to hide the chemistry\nDrive a little too slow, take the long way home\nGet a little too close\nWe do, but friends don't\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey don't almost say \"I love you\"\nWhen they're downtown somewhere, just a little drunk\nThey don't talk about the future and put each other in it\nAnd get chills with every accidental touch\n\n[Chorus]\nFriends don't call you in the middle of the night\nCouldn't even tell you why\nThey just felt like saying \"hi\"\nFriends don't stand around, playing with their keys\nFinding reasons not to leave\nTrying to hide the chemistry\nDrive a little too slow, take the long way home\nGet a little too close\nWe do, but friends don't\n\n[Bridge]\nI keep telling myself this might be nothing\nBut one look in your eyes and, God, there's something\nYou can lie to me and say you don't\nBut I know you do, and I love you too\n\n[Chorus]\nFriends don't call you in the middle of the night\nCouldn't even tell you why\nThey just felt like saying \"hi\"\nFriends don't stand around, playing with their keys\nFinding reasons not to leave\nTrying to hide the chemistry\nDrive a little too slow, take the long way home\nGet a little too close\nWe do, but friends don't\nFriends don't\n\n"}
