{"song": "Heartaches By The Number", "artist": "Ray Price", "lyrics": "\n\nHeartache number one was when you left me\nI never knew that I could hurt this way\nAnd heartache number two was when you came back again\nYou came back and never meant to stay\n\nNow I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score\nEvery day you love me less\nEach day I love you more\n\nYes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win\nBut the day that I'll stop counting\nThat's the day my world would end\n\nHeartache number three was when you called me\nAnd said that you were coming back to stay\nWith hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door\nI waited, but you must have lost your way\n\nNow I've got heartaches by the number\nAnd the day that I'll stop counting\nThat's the day my world will end\n\n"}
