{"song": "When Legends Rise", "artist": "Godsmack", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nLegs are tied, these hands are broken\nAlone I try with words unspoken\nSilent cry, my breath is frozen\nWith blinded eyes, I fear myself!\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's burning down, it's burning high\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\nWe burned it out oh my oh why ?\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise !\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy throat is dry, my vision's fading\nI'm paralyzed and left here waiting\nTaking time just one step forward\nWon't lose my mind, I'm here to stay\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's burning down, it's burning high\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\nWe burned it out oh my oh why ?\nWhen ashes fall he legends rise !\n\n[Bridge]\nWhoa!\nLegends rise!\nWhoa !\nLegends rise! (Legends rise, rise, rise)\nLegends rise ! (Rise, rise, rise, rise)\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Hook-Spoken]\nYOU GONNA DO SOMETHIN` ABOUT IT\nOR JUST STAND THERE AND BLEED?\n\n[Refrain]\nLegends rise!\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's burning down, it's burning high\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\nWe burned it out oh my oh why ?\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise!\n\n[Refrain]\nWhoa!\nLegends rise!\nWhoa!\nLegends rise!\n\n[Outro]\n\n"}
