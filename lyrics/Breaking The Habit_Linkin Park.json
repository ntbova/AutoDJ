{"song": "Breaking The Habit", "artist": "Linkin Park", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nMemories consume, like opening the wound\nI'm picking me apart again\nYou all assume I'm safe here in my room\nUnless I try to start again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't want to be the one\nThe battles always choose\n'Cause inside, I realize\nThat I'm the one confused\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what's worth fighting for\nOr why I have to scream\nI don't know why I instigate\nAnd say what I don't mean\n\nI don't know how I got this way\nI know it's not alright\nSo, I'm breaking the habit\nI'm breaking the habit tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nClutching my cure, I tightly lock the door\nI try to catch my breath again\nI hurt much more than anytime, before\nI had no options left again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't want to be the one\nThe battles always choose\n'Cause inside, I realize\nThat I'm the one confused\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what's worth fighting for\nOr why I have to scream\nI don't know why I instigate\nAnd say what I don't mean\n\nI don't know how I got this way\nI'll never be alright\nSo, I'm breaking the habit\nI'm breaking the habit tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nI'll paint it on the walls\n'Cause I'm the one at fault\nI'll never fight, again\nAnd this is how it ends\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what's worth fighting for\nOr why I have to scream\nBut now I have some clarity\nTo show you what I mean\nI don't know how I got this way\n\nI'll never be alright\nSo, I'm breaking the habit\nI'm breaking the habit\nI\u2019m breaking the habit tonight\n\n"}
