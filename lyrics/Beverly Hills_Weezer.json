{"song": "Beverly Hills", "artist": "Weezer", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse]\nWhere I come from isn't all that great\nMy automobile is a piece of crap\nMy fashion sense is a little whack\nAnd my friends are just as screwy as me\nI didn't go to boarding schools\nPreppie girls never looked at me\nWhy should they?\nI ain't nobody\nGot nothing in my pocket\n\n[Chorus]\nBeverly Hills\nThat's where I want to be (gimme, gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nRollin' like a celebrity (gimme, gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n\n[Verse]\nLook at all those movie stars\nThey're all so beautiful and clean\nWhen the housemaids scrub the floors\nThey get the spaces in between\nI wanna live a life like that\nI wanna be just like a king\nTake my picture by the pool\nCause I'm the next big thing\n\n[Chorus]\nBeverly Hills\nThat's where I want to be (gimme, gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nRollin' like a celebrity (gimme, gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n\n[Bridge]\nThe truth is I don't stand a chance\nIt's something that you're born into\nAnd I just don't belong\n\n[Verse]\nNo I don't\nI'm just a no class, beat down fool\nAnd I will always be that way\nI might as well enjoy my life\nAnd watch the stars play\n\n[Chorus]\nBeverly Hills\nThat's where I want to be (gimme, gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nRollin' like a celebrity (gimme, gimme)\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n\n[Outro]\nBeverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nBeverly Hills\nLivin' in Beverly Hills\n\n"}
