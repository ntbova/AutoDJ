{"song": "Fascination Street", "artist": "The Cure", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nOh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street\nSo let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit\nBecause I feel it all fading and paling, and I'm begging\nTo drag you down with me to kick the last nail in\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream\nBut if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible\nFor quite what goes in or to care what comes out\nSo just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd let's move to the beat like we know that it's over\nIf you slip going under, slip over my shoulder\nSo just pull on your face, just pull on your feet\nAnd let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo pull on your hair, pull on your pout\nCut the conversation, just open your mouth\nSo just pull on your face, just pull on your feet\nAnd let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street\n\n[Outro]\nDown on Fascination Street\nDown on Fascination Street\nDown on Fascination Street\nDown on Fascination Street\n\n"}
