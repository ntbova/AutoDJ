{"song": "How Do I Live", "artist": "LeAnn Rimes", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow do I get through one night without you?\nIf I had to live without you\nWhat kind of life would that be?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold\nYou're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave\nBaby you would take away everything good in my life\nAnd tell me now\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live without you? I want to know\nHow do I breathe without you if you ever go?\nHow do I ever, ever survive?\nHow do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWithout you there'd be no sun in my sky\nThere would be no love in my life\nThere'd be no world left for me\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd I, baby, I don't know what I would do\nI'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave\nBaby, you would take away everything real in my life\nAnd tell me now\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live without you? I want to know\nHow do I breathe without you if you ever go?\nHow do I ever, ever survive?\nHow do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?\n\n[Bridge]\nPlease, tell me, baby\nHow do I go on if you ever leave?\nBaby, you would take away everything, I need you with me\nBaby, don't you know that you're everything good in my life?\nAnd tell me now\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live without you? I want to know\nHow do I breathe without you if you ever go\nHow do I ever, ever survive?\nHow do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?\nHow do I live without you?\nHow do I live without you, baby?\nHow do I live?\n\n"}
