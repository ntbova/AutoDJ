(You've had a few?)\n'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)\nMaybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)\nBusy bein' yours (Being yours)\nTo fall for somebody new\nNow, I've thought it through\nCrawlin' back to you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n(Do I wanna know?)\nIf this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go)\nWas sorta hopin' that you\u2019d stay\n(Baby, we both know)\nThat the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can\u2019t say tomorrow day\n\n[Outro]\n(Do I wanna know?)\nToo busy bein' yours to fall\n(Sad to see you go)\nEver thought of callin', darlin'?\n(Do I wanna know?)\nDo you want me crawlin' back to you?\n\n"}
