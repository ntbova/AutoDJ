{"song": "Holiday", "artist": "Green Day", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nSay hey!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHear the sound of the falling rain\nComing down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)\nThe shame, the ones who died without a name\nHear the dogs howling out of key\nTo a hymn called \"Faith and Misery\" (Hey!)\nAnd bleed, the company lost the war today\n\n[Chorus]\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nOn holiday\n\n[Verse 2]\nHear the drum pounding out of time\nAnother protester has crossed the line (Hey!)\nTo find the money's on the other side\nCan I get another Amen? (Amen!)\nThere's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)\nA gag, a plastic bag on a monument\n\n[Chorus]\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nOn holiday\n\n[Interlude]\n\"The representative from California has the floor\"\n\n[Bridge]\nSieg Heil to the president Gasman\nBombs away is your punishment\nPulverize the Eiffel towers\nWho criticize your government\nBang bang goes the broken glass\nAnd kill all the fags that don't agree\nTrials by fire, setting fire\nIs not a way that's meant for me\nJust \u2018cause, just \u2018cause\nBecause we're outlaws, yeah!\n\n[Chorus]\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nI beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies\nThis is the dawning of the rest of our lives\nThis is our lives on holiday\n\n"}
