{"song": "Is He Worthy?", "artist": "Chris Tomlin", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nDo you feel the world is broken? (We do)\nDo you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)\nBut do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? (We do)\nDo you wish that you could see it all made new? (We do)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIs all creation groaning? (It is)\nIs a new creation coming? (It is)\nIs the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (It is)\nIs it good that we remind ourselves of this? (It is)\n\n[Chorus]\nIs anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?\nIs anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?\nThe Lion of Judah who conquered the grave\nHe is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave\n\n[Refrain 1]\nIs He worthy? Is He worthy\nOf all blessing and honor and glory?\nIs He worthy of this?\nHe is\n\n[Verse 3]\nDoes the Father truly love us? (He does)\nDoes the Spirit move among us? (He does)\nAnd does Jesus, our Messiah, hold forever those He loves? (He does)\nDoes our God intend to dwell again with us? (He does)\n\n[Chorus]\nIs anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?\nIs anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?\nThe Lion of Judah who conquered the grave\nHe is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave\n\n[Bridge]\nFrom every people and tribe (People and tribe)\nEvery nation and tongue (Every nation and tongue)\nHe has made us a kingdom and priests to God\nTo reign with the Son\n\n[Refrain 2]\nIs He worthy? Is He worthy\nOf all blessing and honor and glory?\nIs He worthy? Is He worthy?\nIs He worthy of this?\n\n[Refrain 3]\nHe is, He is\nIs He worthy? Is He worthy?\nHe is, He is\nHe is worthy, He is worthy\nHe is\n\n"}
