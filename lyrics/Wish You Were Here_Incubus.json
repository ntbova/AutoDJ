{"song": "Wish You Were Here", "artist": "Incubus", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI dig my toes into the sand\nThe ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket\nI lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless\nAnd in this moment I am happy\u2013happy\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\n\n[Verse 2]\nI lay my head onto the sand\nThe sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it\nI'm counting UFOs, I signal them with my lighter\nAnd in this moment I am happy\u2013happy\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe world's a roller coaster\nAnd I am not strapped in\nMaybe I should hold with care\nBut my hands are busy in the air saying\n\n[Bridge]\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were...\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were here\nI wish you were...\nHere, wish you were here\n\n"}
