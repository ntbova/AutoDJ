{"song": "When I Come Around", "artist": "Green Day", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI heard you crying loud\nAll the way across town\nYou've been searching for that someone\nAnd it's me out on the prowl\nAs you sit around feeling sorry for yourself\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, don't get lonely now\nAnd dry your whining eyes\nI'm just roamin' for the moment\nSleazin' my backyard, so don't get\nSo uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me\n\n[Chorus]\nNo time to search the world around\n\u2018Cause you know where I'll be found\nWhen I come around\n\n[Verse 3]\nI heard it all before\nSo don't knock down my door\nI'm a loser and a user\nSo I don't need no accuser\nTo try and slag me down\nBecause I know you're right\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo go do what you like\nMake sure you do it wise\nYou may find out that your self-doubt\nMeans nothing was ever there\nYou can't go forcing something if it's just not right\n\n[Chorus]\nNo time to search the world around\n\u2018Cause you know where I'll be found\nWhen I come around\n\n[Outro]\nNo time to search the world around\n\u2018Cause you know where I'll be found\nWhen I come around\nWhen I come around\nWhen I come around\nWhen I come around\n\n"}
