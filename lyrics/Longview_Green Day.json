{"song": "Longview", "artist": "Green Day", "lyrics": "\n\n[Instrumental Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on\nI change the channels for an hour or two\nTwiddle my thumbs just for a bit\nI'm sick of all the same old shit\nIn a house with unlocked doors\nAnd I'm fuckin' lazy\n\n[Chorus]\nBite my lip and close my eyes\nTake me away to paradise\nI'm so damn bored, I'm going blind\nAnd I smell like shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving\nI sure as hell can't do it by myself\nI'm feeling like a dog in heat\nBarred indoors from the summer street\nI locked the door to my own cell\nAnd I lost the key\n\n[Chorus]\nBite my lip and close my eyes\nTake me away to paradise\nI'm so damn bored, I'm going blind\nAnd I smell like shit\n\n[Bridge]\nI got no motivation\nWhere is my motivation?\nNo time for motivation\nSmoking my inspiration\n\n[Verse 3]\nI sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling\nCall me pathetic, call me what you will\nMy mother says to get a job\nBut she don't like the one she's got\nWhen masturbation's lost its fun\nYou're fucking lonely\n\n[Chorus 2]\nBite my lip and close my eyes\nTake me away to paradise\nI'm so damn bored, I'm going blind\nAnd loneliness has to suffice\n\n[Chorus 3]\nBite my lip and close my eyes\nI'm slipping away to paradise\nSome say quit or I'll go blind\nBut it's just a myth\n\n"}
