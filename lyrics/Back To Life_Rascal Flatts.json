{"song": "Back To Life", "artist": "Rascal Flatts", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe got that 'hey y'all' little southern draw that she got from her mama\nLikes coffee with her sugar in the morning\nShe likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror\nLoves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoesn't matter what we're listening to\nSpinning her around the living room\nAnd I fall apart every time\n\n[Chorus]\nShe puts that beat in my chest\nPounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder\nTaking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under\nMy dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes\nShe brings me back to life\nYes, she does\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe's got her feet on the dash\nHair blowing back, hand out the window\nMaking up half the words that she's singing\nAnd she takes an hour to pick a  movie out\nFive minutes in and she's passing out\nAnd I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'd stay there forever if I could\nDoing nothing never felt so good\nAnd I wish that I could stop time\n\n[Chorus]\nShe puts that beat in my chest\nPounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder\nTaking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under\nMy dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes\nShe brings me back to life\nOh, yes she does\nAnd I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh\nShe puts that beat in my chest\nPounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder\nTaking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under\nMy dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa\nYeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes\nShe brings me back to life\n\n[Outro]\nOh, she does\nBack to life\n\n"}
