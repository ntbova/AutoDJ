{"song": "The Sound Of Winter", "artist": "Bush", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nMind strong, body strong\nTry to find equilibrium\nHead straight, screwed on\nWe screwed up for too long\nI don't want to lean on the waves\nI watched the storm evaporate\nI think of you and starry skies\nThat keeps you so alive\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's walk through the fire together\nDisappear in the golden sands\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all in your face\nI see a break\nIt's like the sound of winter\nThe bleeding of love\nThe silent escape\nYou've got to hang on to yourself\nIt's like the sound of winter\n\n[Verse 2]\nMedusa smiles and Judas lips\nOpen arms and finger tips\nLove bites, and recompense\nI'll be with you until the end\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's walk through the fire together\nDisappear in the golden sands\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all in your face\nI see a break\nIt's like the sound of winter\nThe bleeding of love\nThe silent escape\nYou've got to hang on to yourself\nIt's like the sound of winter\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all in your face\nI see a break\nIt's like the sound of winter\nThe bleeding of love\nThe silent escape\nYou've got to hang on to yourself\nIt's like the sound of winter\n\n[Interlude]\nHang on to yourself\nHang on to yourself\nIt's like the sound of winter\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's all in your face\nI see a break\nIt's like the sound of winter\nThe bleeding of love\nThe silent escape\nYou've got to hang on to yourself\nIt's like the sound of winter\n\n[Outro]\nIt's like the sound of winter\nHang on to yourself\nHang on to yourself\n\n"}
