I'm so crazy about mine\n\n[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]\nGoin' insane, feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain\nI know I don't have to argue about everything\nBut we don't have the same soul\nWould've sold yours too and got a bigger bankroll\nYou tell me that you love me, baby, say it again\nRepeat it over and over until it's in my brain\nPicked up the drugs so I let my brain go\nWoulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nShorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china\nTell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her\nThen I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver\nAnd her last man was a pussy, had a vagina\nI get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies\nIt's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise\nSo if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die\nDid I say that out loud?
