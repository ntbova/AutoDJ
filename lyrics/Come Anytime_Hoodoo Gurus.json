{"song": "Come Anytime", "artist": "Hoodoo Gurus", "lyrics": "\n\nWhat is it you want from me?\nThere isn't much I will not do\nIf it's only company\nYou know, I might need that too\nWon't you?\n\nCome anytime\nI'm a man of leisure\nCome anytime\nI await your pleasure\n\nThere's nothing new beneath the sun\nWe've butchered every sacred cow\nDon't tell me about all the things you might have done\nJust tell me what are you doing now right now\n\nCome anytime\nI won't give you pressure\nCome anytime\nI can wait forever\nAnd if you can't make up your mind\nWe could make it up together\n\nThings like this happen every day\nWhatever happens\nIt's O.K\nWhy be afraid when we've got it made\nI'll never ask you to explain\n\nWhat is it you want from me?\nYou won't shock me easily\nMaybe it's your heart's desire\nMaybe it's your wildest dream\nMaybe I'm a gun-for-hire\nBut baby, don't we make quite a team, don't we?\nDon't we?\n\nCome anytime\n(You're so inclined)\nI won't give you trouble\nCome anytime (you're going blind)\nOr you're seeing double\nAnd I have never been the kind\nWho'd want to burst your bubble\nCome anytime\n\n"}
