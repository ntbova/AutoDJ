{"song": "You'Ve Never Been This Far Before", "artist": "Conway Twitty", "lyrics": "\n\nI can almost hear the stillness\nAs it yields to the sound of your heart beating\nAnd I can almost hear the echo\nOf the thoughts that I know you must be thinking\n\nAnd I can feel your body tremble\nAs you wonder what this moment holds in store\nAnd as I put my arms around you\nI can tell you've never been this far before\n\nI don't know what I'm saying\nAs my trembling fingers touch forbidden places\nI only know I've waited\nFor so long for the chance that we are taking\n\nI don't know and I don't care\nWhat made you tell him you don't love him anymore\nAnd as I taste your tender kisses\nI can tell you've never been this far before\n\nAnd as I take the love you're giving\nI can feel the tension building in your mind\nAnd you're wondering if tomorrow\nI'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight\n\nYou have no way of knowing\nBut tonight will only make me love you more\nAnd I hope that you'll believe me\n'Cause I know you've never been this far before\n\n"}
