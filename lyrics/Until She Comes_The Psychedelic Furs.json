{"song": "Until She Comes", "artist": "The Psychedelic Furs", "lyrics": "\n\nUntil she comes again\nI can hear the things she said\nI feel no thoughts to move my head\nUntil she comes again\n\nAnd with her step I move my feet\nAnd with her hand I feel my skin\nAnd with her need I find I'm saved\nAnd with her dreams I'm laid\n\nUntil she comes again\nThe sun goes out and night comes in\nThe time goes 'round and day grows dim\nUntil she comes again\n\nAnd with her step I move my feet\nAnd with her hand I feel my skin\nAnd with her need I find I'm saved\nAnd with her dreams I'm laid\n\nI can't be saved from my wounds\nUntil she comes\nI can't be saved from my wounds\nUntil she comes\n\nUntil she comes again\nWith all my saving and my sins\nThere's no good reason to begin\nUntil she comes again\n\nAnd with her step I move my feet\nAnd with her hand I feel my skin\nAnd with her need I find I'm saved\nAnd with her dreams I'm laid\n\nI can't be saved from my wounds\nUntil she comes\nI can't be saved from my wounds\nUntil she comes\n\nUntil she comes again\nWith all her dreams tied in her hand\nThere is no why to understand\nUntil she comes again\n\nUntil she comes again\nThe sun goes out and night comes in\nThe time goes 'round and day grows dim\nUntil she comes again\n\n"}
