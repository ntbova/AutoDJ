{"song": "Santa Monica (Watch The World Die)", "artist": "Everclear", "lyrics": "\n\nI am still living with your ghost\nLonely and dreaming of the west coast\nI don't want to be your downtime\nI don't want to be your stupid game\n\nWith my big black boots and an old suitcase\nI do believe I'll find myself a new place\nI don't want to be the bad guy\nI don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore\nI just want to see some palm trees\nI will try and shake away this disease\n\nWe can live beside the ocean\nLeave the fire behind\nSwim out past the breakers\nWatch the world die\nWe can live beside the ocean\nLeave the fire behind\nSwim out past the breakers\nWatch the world die\n\nI am still dreaming of your face\nHungry and hollow for all the things you took away\nI don't want to be your good time\nI don't want to be your fall back crutch anymore\n\nI'll walk right out into a brand new day\nInsane and rising in my own weird way\nI don't want to be the bad guy\nI don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore\nI just want to feel some sunshine\nI just want to find some place to be alone\n\nWe can live beside the ocean\nLeave the fire behind\nSwim out past the breakers\nWatch the world die\nWe can live beside the ocean\nLeave the fire behind\nSwim out past the breakers\nWatch the world die\n\nWe can live beside the ocean\nLeave the fire behind\nSwim out past the breakers\nWatch the world die\nWe can live beside the ocean\nLeave the fire behind\nSwim out past the breakers\nWatch the world die\n\nOh, yeah, watch the world die\nYeah, yeah, watch the world die\nWhoa, yeah, watch the world die\nYeah, watch the world die\n\n"}
