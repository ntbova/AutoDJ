{"song": "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)", "artist": "Whitney Houston", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI want to dance\nClocks strikes upon the hour\nAnd the sun begins to fade\nStill enough time to figure out\nHow to chase my blues away\nI've done alright up 'til now\nIt's the light of day that shows me how\nAnd when the night falls\nLoneliness calls\n\n[Chorus]\nOh! I want to dance with somebody\nI want to feel the heat with somebody\nYeah! I want to dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\nOh! I want to dance with somebody\nI want to feel the heat with somebody\nYeah! I want to dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been in love and lost my senses\nSpinning through the town\nSooner or later the fever ends\nAnd I wind up feeling down\nI need a man who'll take a chance\nOn a love that burns hot enough to last\nSo when the night falls\nMy lonely heart calls\n\n[Chorus]\nOh! I want to dance with somebody\nI want to feel the heat with somebody\nYeah! I want to dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\nOh! I want to dance with somebody\nI want to feel the heat\nWith somebody\nYeah! I want to dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n[Bridge]\nSomebody who, somebody who\nSomebody who loves me\nSomebody who, somebody who\nTo hold me in his arms\nI need a man who'll take a chance\nOn a love that burns hot enough to last\nSo when the night falls\nMy lonely heart calls\n\n[Chorus]\nOh! I want to dance with somebody\nI want to feel the heat with somebody\nYeah! I want to dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\nOh! I want to dance with somebody\nI want to feel the heat with somebody\nYeah! I want to dance with somebody\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n[Outro]\nDance\nC'mon baby\nDance\nDance\nGet with this boy\nDance\nDon't you want to dance\nDance\nWith me baby\nDon't you want to dance\nDance\nWith me boy\nHey don't you want to dance\nDance\nWith me baby\nWith somebody who loves me\nDon't you want to dance say you want to dance\nDon't you want to dance\nDance\nDon't you want to dance say you want to dance\nDon't you want to dance\nDance\nDon't you want to dance say you want to dance\nDance\nWith somebody who loves me\nDance\nDance\nHey baby\nDance\n\n"}
