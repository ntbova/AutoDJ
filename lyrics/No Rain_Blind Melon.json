{"song": "No Rain", "artist": "Blind Melon", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll I can say is that my life is pretty plain\nI like watching the puddles gather rain\nAnd all I can do is just pour some tea for two\nAnd speak my point of view, but it's not sane\nIt's not sane\n\n[Chorus]\nI just want someone to say to me:\n\"I'll always be there when you wake\"\nYou know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry, today\nSo, stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I don't understand why I sleep all day\nAnd I start to complain that there's no rain\nAnd all I can do is read a book to stay awake\nAnd it rips my life away, but it's a great escape\nEscape\nEscape\nEscape\n\n[Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll I can say is that my life is pretty plain\nYou don't like my point of view\nYou think that I'm insane\nIt's not sane\nIt's not sane\n\n[Chorus]\nI just want someone to say to me:\n\"I'll always be there when you wake\"\nYou know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry, today\nSo, stay with me and I'll have it made\nI'll have it made\nI'll have it made\nI'll have it made\nI'll have it made\n\n"}
