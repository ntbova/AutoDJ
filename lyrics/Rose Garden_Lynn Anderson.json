{"song": "Rose Garden", "artist": "Lynn Anderson", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine\nThere's got to be a little rain sometimes\nWhen you take you got to give\nSo live and let live\nOr let gooooo\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\n\nI could promise you things like big diamond rings\nBut you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover\nSo you better think it over\nWell if sweet talking you could make it come true\nI would give you the world right now on a silver platter\nBut what would it matter\n\n[Chorus]\nSo smile for a while and let's be jolly\nLove shouldn't be so melancholy\nCome along and share the good times while we can\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine\nThere's got to be a little rain sometimes\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could sing you a tune and promise you the moon\nBut if that's what it takes to hold you\nI'd just as soon let you go\nBut there's one thing I want you to know\nYou better look before you leap\nStill waters run deep\nAnd there won't always be someone there to pull you out\nAnd you know what I'm talking about\n\n[Chorus]\nSo smile for a while and let's be jolly\nLove shouldn't be so melancholy\nCome along and share the good times while we can\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine\nThere's got to be a little rain sometimes\n\n"}
