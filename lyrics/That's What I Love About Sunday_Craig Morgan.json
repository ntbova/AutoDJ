{"song": "That's What I Love About Sunday", "artist": "Craig Morgan", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nRaymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest\nIn oil and grease\nThere's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid\nWho broke a window last week\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThat's what I love about Sunday\nSing along as the choir sways\nEvery verse of Amazing Grace\nAnd then we shake the preacher's hand\nGo home, into your blue jeans\nHave some chicken and some baked beans\nPick a backyard football team\nNot do much of anything\nThat's what I love about Sunday\n\n[Verse 2]\nI stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times\nGrab a coffee cup\nIt looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot\nWell, it's about time\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nIt's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThat's what I love about Sunday\nCat-napping on the porch swing\nYou curled up next to me\nThe smell of jasmine wakes us up\nTake a walk down a back road\nTackle box and a cane pole\nCarve our names in that white oak\nAnd steal a kiss as the sun fades\nThat's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, new believers getting baptized\nMomma's hands raised up high\nAin't it a Hallelujah good time\nA smile on everybody's face\nThat's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah\n\n[Outro]\nThat's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah\n\n"}
