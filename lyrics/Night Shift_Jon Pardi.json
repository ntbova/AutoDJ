{"song": "Night Shift", "artist": "Jon Pardi", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's been a wreck me week\nSixty plus from dawn to dusk\nIn the red dirt heat\nBusting it up for a couple of bucks\nBut it ain't no thing\nJust another day till I'm on my way\nTo them cool, cool sheets and you and me\n\n[Chorus]\nWorking on the night shift, baby\nDying for your touch like crazy\nRacking up the overtime hours\nLoving how we're working on the night shift, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nGonna rock it right\nNo need to talk, I know what you want\nAnd what you like\nCause I do too, yeah\nI love how you leave on the lights\nNot a thing between you and me\nAnd it feels so nice when you and I are\n\n[Chorus]\nWorking on the night shift, baby\nDying for your touch like crazy\nRacking up the overtime hours\nLoving how we're working on the night shift, baby\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, yeah\nIt's been a wreck me week\nOh, but who needs sleep?\n\n[Chorus]\nWorking on the night shift, baby\nDying for your touch like crazy\nRacking up the overtime hours\nLoving how we're working on the night shift, baby\nLoving how we're working on the night shift\nLoving how we're working on the night shift\nWorking on the night shift, baby\n\n"}
