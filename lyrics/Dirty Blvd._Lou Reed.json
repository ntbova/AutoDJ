{"song": "Dirty Blvd.", "artist": "Lou Reed", "lyrics": "\n\nPedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel\nHe looks out a window without glass\nThe walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet\nHis father beats him cause he's too tired to beg\n\nHe's got 9 brothers and sisters\nThey're brought up on their knees\nIt's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs\nPedro dreams of being older and killing the old man\nBut that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard\n\nHe's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard\nHe's going out, to the dirty boulevard\nHe's going down, to the dirty boulevard\n\nThis room cost 2,000 dollars a month\nYou can believe it man it's true\nSomewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants\nNo one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything\nThey dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard\n\nGive me your hungry, your tired your poor I'll piss on 'em\nThat's what the Statue of Bigotry says\nYour poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death\nAnd get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard\n\nGet 'em out, on the dirty boulevard\nGoing out, to the dirty boulevard\nThey're going down, on the dirty boulevard\nGoing out\n\nOutside it's a bright night\nThere's an opera at Lincoln Center\nMovie stars arrive by limousine\nThe klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan\nBut the lights are out on the Mean Streets\n\nA small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel\nHe's selling plastic roses for a buck\nThe traffic's backed up to 39th street\nThe TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck\n\nAnd back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming\nHe's found a book on magic in a garbage can\nHe looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling\n\"At the count of 3\" he says, \"I hope I can disappear\"\n\nAnd fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard\nI want to fly, from dirty boulevard\nI want to fly, from dirty boulevard\nI want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard\n\nI want to fly away\nI want to fly\nFly, fly away\nI want to fly\nFly-fly away (Fly a-)\nFly-fly-fly (-way, ooohhh...)\nFly-fly away (I want to fly-fly away)\nFly away (I want to fly, wow-woh, no, fly away)\n\n"}
