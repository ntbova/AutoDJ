{"song": "To Sir With Love", "artist": "Lulu", "lyrics": "\n\nThose schoolgirl days\nOf telling tales and biting nails are gone\nBut in my mind\nI know they will still live on and on\n\nBut how do you thank someone\nWho has taken you from crayons to perfume?\nIt isn't easy, but I'll try\n\nIf you wanted the sky\nI would write across the sky in letters\nThat would soar a thousand feet high\n\"To Sir, with love\"\n\nThe time has come\nFor closing books and long last looks must end\nAnd as I leave\nI know that I am leaving my best friend\n\nA friend who taught me right from wrong\nAnd weak from strong, that's a lot to learn\nWhat, what can I give you in return?\n\nIf you wanted the moon\nI would try to make a start\nBut I would rather you let me give my heart\nTo Sir, with love\n\n"}
