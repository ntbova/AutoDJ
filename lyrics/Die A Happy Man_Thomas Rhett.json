{"song": "Die A Happy Man", "artist": "Thomas Rhett", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nBaby, last night was hands down\nOne of the best nights that I've had, no doubt\nBetween the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye\nThen we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know that I can't ever tell you enough\nThat all I need in this life is your crazy love\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIf I never get to see the Northern lights\nOr if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night\nOh, if all I got is your hand in my hand\nBaby, I could die a happy man\nA happy man, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby, that red dress brings me to my knees\nOh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe\nYou\u2019re a saint, you\u2019re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece\nIt's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know that I can't ever tell you enough\nThat all I need in this life is your crazy love\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIf I never get to see the Northern lights\nOr if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night\nOh, if all I got is your hand in my hand\nBaby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah\nMmm\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't need no vacation, no fancy destination\nBaby, you're my great escape\nWe could stay at home, listen to the radio\nDance around the fireplace\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia\nOr drive a sports car up the coast of California\nOh, if all I got is your hand in my hand\nBaby, I could die a happy man\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBaby, I could die a happy man\nOh, I could die a happy man\nYou know I could, girl\nI could die, I could die a happy man\nMmm\n\n"}
