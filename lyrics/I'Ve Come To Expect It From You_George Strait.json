{"song": "I'Ve Come To Expect It From You", "artist": "George Strait", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo upset, a nervous wreck, can't believe you said goodbye\nSit and smoke, cry and joke about these tears in my eyes\nHow could you do what you've gone and done to me?\nI wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me\nBut that's what I get, I've come to expect it from you\n\n[Verse 2]\nA million times, a million lines, and I bought them, every one\nYou don't care, you rip and tear every dream I've counted on\nI guess that I should thank my unlucky stars\nThat I'm alive and you're the way you are\nBut that's what I get, I've come to expect it from you\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow could you do what you've gone and done to me?\nI wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me\nBut that's what I get, I've come to expect it from you\n\n[Verse 4]\nI could raise hell, but what the hell\nIt wouldn't do a bit of good\nPack and leave, my heart agrees; it seems to think that I should\nThere won't be no more next time doing me wrong\nYou'll come back this time to find out that I'm gone\nBut that's what you get, you should expect that from me\n\n[Outro]\nThat's what I get, I've come to expect it from you\n\n"}
