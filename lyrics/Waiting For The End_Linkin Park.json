{"song": "Waiting For The End", "artist": "Linkin Park", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro: Mike Shinoda]\nThis is not the end, this is not the beginning\nJust a voice like a riot rocking every revision\nBut you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm\nAnd though the words sound steady\nSomething empty's within them\nWe say yeah, with fists flying up in the air\nLike we're holding onto something that's invisible there\n'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear\nUntil we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear\n\n[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]\nWaiting for the end to come\nWishing I had strength to stand\nThis is not what I had planned\nIt's out of my control\nFlying at the speed of light\nThoughts were spinning in my head\nSo many things were left unsaid\nIt's hard to let you go\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI know what it takes to move on\nI know how it feels to lie\nAll I want to do is trade this life for something new\nHolding on to what I haven't got\n\n[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]\nSitting in an empty room\nTrying to forget the past\nThis was never meant to last\nI wish it wasn't so\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI know what it takes to move on\nI know how it feels to lie\nAll I want to do is trade this life for something new\nHolding on to what I haven't got\n\n[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]\nWhat was left when that fire was gone?\nI thought it felt right, but that right was wrong\nAll caught up in the eye of the storm\nAnd trying to figure out what it's like moving on\nAnd I don't even know what kind of things I said\nMy mouth kept moving and my mind went dead\nSo, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin\nThe hardest part of ending is starting again\n\n[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]\nAll I want to do is trade this life for something new\nHolding on to what I haven't got\nThis is not the end, this is not the beginning\nJust a voice like a riot, rocking every revision\nI'm holding on to what I haven't got\nBut you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm\nThough the words sound steady\nSomething empty's within them\nWe say yeah, with fists flying up in the air\nLike we're holding onto something that's invisible there\nHolding on to what I haven't got\n'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear\nUntil we get it, forget it, let it all disappear\n\n"}
