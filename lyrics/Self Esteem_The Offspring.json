Yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I'll relate this little bit\nThat happens more than I'd like to admit\nLate at night, she knocks on my door\nShe's drunk again and looking to score\nNow I know I should say no\nBut it's kind of hard when she's ready to go\nI may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb\nI'm just a sucker with no self-esteem\n\n[Chorus]\nOh yeah yeah yeah\nOh yeah yeah\nOh yeah yeah yeah\nOh yeah yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen she's saying, oh, that she wants only me\nThen I wonder why she sleeps with my friends\nWhen she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease\nThen I wonder how much more I can spend\nWell, I guess I should stick up for myself\nBut I really think it's better this way\nThe more you suffer\nThe more it shows you really care\nRight? Yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n"}
