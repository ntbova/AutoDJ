{"song": "Charlotte Anne", "artist": "Julian Cope", "lyrics": "\n\nAnd in my room\nI'm alone in my room\nAnd maybe staying here for just awhile\nAnd in my casket\nI'm alone in my gloom\nAnd maybe staying here for awhile\n\nOh, can't you see light is only in your eyes?\nWould I be guilty?\nOh, would I be?\nThe sound you bring is an antiquated thing\nSo please don't look to me for guidance\n\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\n\nMy splendid art\nOh, my sad profession\nNow stick with me and I'll betray you\nFor should I lose my bad depression\nMy splendid art\nI will betray you\n\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\n\nHaul me out of the water\nHaul me onto the land\nBeneath the sky\nThere is an open fire\nI do understand\n\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\nCharlotte Anne\nI do understand\n\n"}
