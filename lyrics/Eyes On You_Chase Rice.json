{"song": "Eyes On You", "artist": "Chase Rice", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe've been to both Carolinas\nSeen a big Montana sky\nDriven up and down the coast a few times\nLondon, Paris, paradise\nBut ain't got much memory of the scenes come to think\nI miss them all\nAnd damn babe, it's all your fault\n\n[Chorus]\nNo matter where we go\nNo matter what we do\nIf you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you\nDon't matter where we've been\nNo there ain't no better view\nThan you in my arms with my eyes on you\nWith my eyes on you\nWith my eyes on you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSpeaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?\nYou and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea\nAnd the night rolled in\nAnd you still talk about that moon that I can't recall\nBut God I saw all I needed to\nMight as well have stayed in the room\n\n[Chorus]\nNo matter where we go\nNo matter what we do\nIf you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you\nDon't matter where we've been\nNo there ain't no better view\nThan you in my arms with my eyes on you\nWith my eyes on you\nWith my eyes on you\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't you remember Times Square?\nAnd people counting down everywhere\n2000-whatever, no I didn't care\nCause baby you were there\nAnd once again\nCouldn't help but stare\n\n[Chorus]\nNo matter where we go\nNo matter what we do\nIf you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you\nDon't matter where we've been\nNo there ain't no better view\nThan you in my arms with my eyes on you\n\n[Bridge]\nHalfway around the world\nOr the local corner booth\nYeah you guessed it girl\nYou know I got my eyes on you\nWe could be on any street\nAny party, any room\nI'll be there all night with my eyes on you\n\n[Outro]\nDon't matter where we've been\nNo there ain't no better view\nThan you in my arms with my eyes on you\n\n"}
