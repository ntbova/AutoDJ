{"song": "You're So Vain", "artist": "Carly Simon", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nSon of a gun\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou walked into the party\nLike you were walking onto a yacht\nYour hat strategically dipped below one eye\nYour scarf it was apricot\nYou had one eye in the mirror\nAs you watched yourself gavotte\nAnd all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner\nThey'd be your partner\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're so vain\nYou probably think this song is about you\nYou're so vain\nI'll bet you think this song is about you\nDon't you? Don't you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou had me several years ago\nWhen I was still quite naive\nWell, you said that we made such a pretty pair\nAnd that you would never leave\nBut you gave away the things you loved\nAnd one of them was me\nI had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee\nClouds in my coffee, and\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're so vain\nYou probably think this song is about you\nYou're so vain\nI'll bet you think this song is about you\nDon't you? Don't you?\nI had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee\nClouds in my coffee, and\nYou're so vain\nYou probably think this song is about you\nYou're so vain\nI'll bet you think this song is about you\nDon't you? Don't you?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I hear you went up to Saratoga\nAnd your horse naturally won\nThen you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia\nTo see the total eclipse of the sun\nWell, you're where you should be all the time\nAnd when you're not, you're with\nSome underworld spy or the wife of a close friend\nWife of a close friend, and\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're so vain\nYou probably think this song is about you\nYou're so vain\nI'll bet you think this song is about you\nDon't you? Don't you?\nYou're so vain\nYou probably think this song is about you\nYou're so vain\nYou probably think this song is about you\nYou're so vain\n\n"}
