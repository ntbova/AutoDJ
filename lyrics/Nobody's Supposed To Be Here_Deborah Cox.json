{"song": "Nobody's Supposed To Be Here", "artist": "Deborah Cox", "lyrics": "\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here\nI tried that love thing for the last time\nMy heart says \"No, no.\" Nobody's supposed to be here\nBut you came along and changed my mind\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've spent all my life on a search to find\nThe love who'll stay for eternity\nThe heaven sent to fulfill my needs\nBut when I turn around, again, love has knocked me down\nMy heart got broken, oh it hurts so bad\nI'm sad to say love wins again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo I placed my heart under lock and key\nTo take some time to take care of me\nBut I turn around and you're standing here\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis time I swear I'm through\nBut, if only you knew how many times I've said those words\nThen fall again, when will I ever learn?\nKnowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly\nMust take a chance, and spread my wings\nLove can make you do some crazy things\n\n[Pre-Chorus & Chorus]\n\n"}
