{"song": "I Will Wait", "artist": "Mumford & Sons", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell I came home\nLike a stone\nAnd I fell heavy into your arms\nThese days of dust\nWhich we've known\nWill blow away with this new sun\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I'll kneel down\nWait for now\nAnd I'll kneel down\nKnow my ground\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo break my step\nAnd relent\nWell you forgave and I won't forget\nKnow what we've seen\nAnd him with less\nNow in some way\nShake the excess\n\n[Hook]\nCause I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I'll be bold\nAs well as strong\nAnd use my head alongside my heart\nSo tame my flesh\nAnd fix my eyes\nA tethered mind, freed from the lies\n\n[Bridge]\nBut I'll kneel down\nWait for now\nI'll kneel down\nKnow my ground\nRaise my hands\nPaint my spirit gold\nAnd bow my head\nKeep my heart slow\n\n[Hook]\nCause I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\n\n"}
