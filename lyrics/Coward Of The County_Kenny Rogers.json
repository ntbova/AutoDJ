{"song": "Coward Of The County", "artist": "Kenny Rogers", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nEveryone considered him\nThe coward of the county\nHe'd never stood one single time\nTo prove the county wrong\nHis mama named him Tommy\nBut folks just called him yellow\nSomething always told me\nThey were reading Tommy wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was only ten years old\nWhen his daddy died in prison\nI looked after Tommy\nCause he was my brother's son\nI still recall the final words\nMy brother said to Tommy\nSon my life is over, but yours has just begun\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise me, son\nNot to do the things I've done\nWalk away from trouble if you can\nNow it don't mean you're weak\nIf you turn the other cheek\nAnd I hope you're old enough to understand\nSon, you don't have to fight to be a man\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's someone for everyone\nAnd Tommy's love was Becky\nIn her arms he didn't have\nTo prove he was a man\nOne day while he was working\nThe Gatlin boys came calling\nThey took turns at Becky\nN'there was three of them\nTommy opened up the door\nAnd saw his Becky crying\nThe torn dress, the shattered look\nWas more than he could stand\nHe reached above the fireplace\nTook down his daddy's picture\nAs a tear fell on his daddy's face\nHe heard these words again\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise me, son\nNot to do the things I've done\nWalk away from trouble if you can\nNow it don't mean you're weak\nIf you turn the other cheek\nAnd I hope you're old enough to understand\nSon, you don't have to fight to be a man\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe Gatlin boys just laughed at him\nWhen he walked into the barroom\nOne of them got up\nAnd met him half way cross the floor\nTommy turned around they said\n\"Hey look, old yella's leavin'\"\nBut you could've heard a pin drop\nWhen Tommy stopped and locked the door\nTwenty years of crawling\nWas bottled up inside him\nHe wasn't holding nothing back\nHe let 'em have it all\nTommy left the bar room\nNot a Gatlin boy was standing\nHe said, \"This one's for Becky\"\nAs he watched the last one fall\nN' I heard him say\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI promised you, Dad\nNot to do the things you've done\nI walk away from trouble when I can\nNow please don't think I'm weak\nI didn't turn the other cheek\nPapa, I sure hope you understand\nSometimes you gotta fight\nWhen you're a man\n\n[Outro]\nEveryone considered him\nThe coward of the county\n\n"}
