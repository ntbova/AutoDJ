{"song": "Pets", "artist": "Porno For Pyros", "lyrics": "\n\nChildren are innocent\nA teenager's fucked up in the head\nAdults are even more fucked up\nAnd elderlies are like children\n\nWill there be another race\nTo come along and take over for us?\nMaybe martians could do\nBetter than we've done\nWe'll make great pets! (x8)\n\nMy friend says we're like the dinosaurs\nOnly we are doing ourselves in\nMuch faster than they\nEver did\nWe'll make great pets! (x8)\n\nWe will make great pets\nWe'll make great pets! (x3)\nWe will make great pets!\nWe'll make great pets! (x3)\n\n"}
