{"song": "You Look So Good In Love", "artist": "George Strait", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nOh, how you sparkle\nAnd oh, how you shine\nThat flush on your cheeks is more than the wine\nAnd he must do something that I didn't do\nWhatever he's doing\nIt looks good on you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou look so good in love\nYou want him\nThat's easy to see\nYou look so good in love\nAnd I wish you still wanted me\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe must have stolen some stars from the sky\nAnd gave them to you to wear in your eyes\nI had my chances\nBut I set you free\nAnd now I wonder why I couldn't see\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDarling, I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you\nBut tonight your beauty is shining through\nAnd I never took the time to let you know\nSo before he takes you away\nPlease let me say\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nYou look so good in love\n\n"}
