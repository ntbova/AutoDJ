Ooh\nAnd I wanna love somebody\nLove somebody like you, yeah\nOh yeah\nHey, I wanna love ya baby\n\n[Guitar Solo + Banjo Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nOh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the night\nShining like its true\nI wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you\nWhen everything that loved someone finally found its way\nWanna be a better man\nI see it in you yeah\nHey, I wanna be that...\n\n"}
