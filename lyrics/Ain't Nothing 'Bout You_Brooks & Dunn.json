{"song": "Ain't Nothing 'Bout You", "artist": "Brooks & Dunn", "lyrics": "\n\nOnce I thought that love was something I could never do\nNever knew that I could feel this much\nBut this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you\nIs more than a reaction to your touch\nIt's a perfect passion and I can't get enough\n\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nThere ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me\nThe way you kiss, The way you cry\nThe way you move when you walk by\nThere's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\n\nIn my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows\nThat never knocked me off my feet\nAll you gotta do is smile at me and down I go\nAnd baby it's no mystery why I surrender\nGirl you got everything\n\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nThere ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me\nThe way you kiss, The way you cry\nThe way you move when you walk by\nThere's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\n\nI love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought\nYour smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on\n\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nThere ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me\nThe way you kiss, The way you cry\nThe way you move when you walk by\nThere's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)\nThat don't do something for me\n\nThe way you look, the way you laugh\nThe way you love with all you have\nYour dance, your drive, You make me feel alive\n\nThe way you talk, the way you tease\nRight now I think you see\nThere ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me\n\n"}
