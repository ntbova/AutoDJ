{"song": "It's Just A Matter Of Time", "artist": "Brook Benton", "lyrics": "\n\nSomeday, someway\nYou'll realize that you've been blind\nYes, darling, you're going to need me again\nIt's just a matter of time\n\nGo on, go on\nUntil you reach the end of the line\nBut I know you'll pass my way again\nIt's just a matter of time\n\nAfter I gave you everything I had\nYou laughed and called me a clown\nRemember, in your search for fortune and fame\nWhat goes up must come down\n\nI know, I know\nThat one day, you'll wake up and find\nThat my love was a true love\nIt's just a matter of time\n\n"}
