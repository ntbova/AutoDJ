{"song": "Fast Talk", "artist": "Houses", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nMe and my best friends cruising down West End Street\nHiding from cops and driving circles around the block all week\nAll of my friends died out on West End Street\nThey say we're born to die young\nBut we're just trying to live in peace\n\n[Chorus]\nSo maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks\nShangri-La dealers at the bus stops\nAnd maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk\nSo if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up\n'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck\nAnd what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?\nThen we'd better run\nThen we'd better run\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll of our friends went crazy on LSD\nSailing their cars through the big bright city streets\nAnd everyone who knows our name\nSays that we ain't ever gonna change\nThey say we're born to die young\nBut we're trying to find a better way\nThey say we're born to die young\nBut we're trying to find a better way\n\n[Chorus]\nMaybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks\nShangri-La dealers at the bus stops\nAnd maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk\nSo if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up\n'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck\nAnd what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?\nThen we'd better run\nThen we'd better run\n\n[Spoken]\nWord up?\nHey, what's up, man?\nJust sitting around and I'm gonna be 32 years old tomorrow\nAnd I feel half completely alive and half completely dead\n\n[Bridge]\nWe hope and we pray day after day\nThey say we're born to die young\nBut we're gonna find a better way\nWe hope and we pray day after day\nThey say we're born to die young\nBut we're trying to find a better way\n\n[Chorus]\nSo maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks\nShangri-La dealers at the bus stops\nAnd maybe God is just a cop that we can fast talk\nSo if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up\n'Cause karma's just different word for bad luck\nAnd what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?\nThen we'd better run\nThen we'd better run\nThen we'd better run\n\n"}
