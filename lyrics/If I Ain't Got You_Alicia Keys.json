{"song": "If I Ain't Got You", "artist": "Alicia Keys", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSome people live for the fortune\nSome people live just for the fame\nSome people live for the power, yeah\nSome people live just to play the game\nSome people think\nThat the physical things\nDefine what's within\nAnd I've been there before\nThat life's a bore\nSo full of the superficial\n\n[Chorus]\nSome people want it all\nBut I don't want nothing at all\nIf it ain't you, baby\nIf I ain't got you, baby\nSome people want diamond rings\nSome just want everything\nBut everything means nothing\nIf I ain't got you, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nSome people search for a fountain\nPromises forever young\nSome people need three dozen roses\nAnd that's the only way to prove you love them\nHand me the world on a silver platter\nAnd what good would it be\nWith no one to share\nNo one who truly cares for me\n\n[Chorus]\nSome people want it all\nBut I don't want nothing at all\nIf it ain't you, baby\nIf I ain't got you, baby\nSome people want diamond rings\nSome just want everything\nBut everything means nothing\nIf I ain't got you, you, you\nSome people want it all\nBut I don't want nothing at all\nIf it ain't you, baby\nIf I ain't got you, baby\nSome people want diamond rings\nSome just want everything\nBut everything means nothing\nIf I ain't got you, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nIf I ain't got you with me, baby oh\nSaid nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing\nIf I ain't got you with me, baby\n\n"}
