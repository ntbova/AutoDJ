{"song": "From A Distance", "artist": "Bette Midler", "lyrics": "\n\nFrom a distance\nThe world looks blue and green\nAnd the snow capped mountains white\nFrom a distance\nThe ocean meets the stream\nAnd the eagle takes to flight\n\nFrom a distance\nThere is harmony\nAnd it echoes through the land\nIt's the voice of hope\nIt's the voice of peace\nIt's the voice of every man\n\nFrom a distance\nWe all have enough\nAnd no one is in need\nAnd there are no guns, no bombs and no disease\nNo hungry mouths to feed\nFrom a Distance\nWe are instruments\nMarching in a common band\nPlaying songs of hope\nPlaying songs of peace\nThey are the songs of every man\n\nGod is watching us\nGod is watching us\nGod is watching us\nFrom a distance\n\nFrom a distance\nYou look like my friend\nEven though we are at war\nFrom a distance\nI just cannot comprehend\nWhat all this fighting is for\nFrom a distance\nThere is harmony\nAnd it echoes through the land\nAnd it's the hope of hopes\nIt's the love of loves\nIt's the heart of every man\n\nIt's the hope of hopes\nIt's the love of loves\nThis is the song of every man\n\nGod is watching us\nGod is watching us\nGod is watching us\nFrom a distance\n\n"}
