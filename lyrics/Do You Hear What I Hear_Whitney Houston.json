{"song": "Do You Hear What I Hear", "artist": "Whitney Houston", "lyrics": "\n\nSaid the little lamb to the shepherd boy\nDo you hear what I hear\nRinging through the night, shepherd boy\nDo you hear what I hear\nA song, a song, high above the trees\nWith a voice as big as the sea\nWith a voice as big as the sea\n\nSaid the shepherd boy to the mighty king\nDo you know what I know\nIn your palace warm, mighty king\nDo you know what I know\nA child, a child, shivers in the cold\nLet us bring him silver and gold\nLet us bring him silver and gold\n\nSaid the king to the people everywhere\nListen to what I say\nPray for peace, people everywhere\nListen to what I say\nA child, a child, sleeping in the night\nHe will bring us goodness and light\nHe will bring us goodness and light\n\n"}
