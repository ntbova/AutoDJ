{"song": "She Got The Best Of Me", "artist": "Luke Combs", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1: Luke Combs]\nSeventeen, you don't think that much about life\nYou just live it\nLike Kerosene dancing around a fire\nBut you're in it\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke Combs]\nSo you jump right in\nAin't afraid to fall\nAnd you give it all\n\n[Chorus: Luke Combs]\nShe got the best of me\nShe broke my heart\nNow all that's left of me\nIs beating in this guitar\nEvery night, a different sound\nShe follows me around\nSo you get what's left of me\nShe got the best of me\n\n[Verse 2: Luke Combs]\nI picked myself up off the floor\nAnd found something new worth living for\nAnd a, old dusty hand-me-down six string\nAnd a couple chords\n\n[Bridge: Luke Combs]\nI'm getting over her\nA little more with every song\nSo sing a-long\n\n[Chorus: Luke Combs]\nShe got the best of me\nShe broke my heart\nNow all that's left of me\nIs beating in this guitar\nEvery night, a different sound\nShe follows me around\nSo you get what's left of me\nShe got the best of me\n\n[Outro: Luke Combs]\nShe got the best of me\nShe got the best of me\nShe got the best of me\n\n"}
