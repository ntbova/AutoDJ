{"song": "Make It Sweet", "artist": "Old Dominion", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI know it's a drag, I know it's a grind\nI know that a dollar ain't worth a dime\nJust trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block\nI know you get tired, I know you get down\nI know you get sick of this soul sucking town\nBut let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me\nI never gotta wonder where my honey be\nI ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night\nSeven days a week I got an appetite\nThe sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen\nDon't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me\nLife is short, make it sweet\n\n[Verse 2]\nOpen sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7\nLet that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair\nAnd let that windshield frame the ocean\nRadio keep coast-to-coastin'\nIf we don't get where we're going baby I don't care\nI'm already there\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me\nI never gotta wonder where my honey be\nI ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night\nSeven days a week I got an appetite\nThe sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen\nDon't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me\nLife is short, make it sweet\n\n[Bridge]\nDays will be long but the years will fly right by\nWe'll never be as young as we are tonight\nBaby ain't that right, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me\nI never gotta wonder where my honey be\nI ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night\nSeven days a week I got an appetite\nThe sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen\nDon't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me\nLife is short, make it sweet\nLife is short, make it sweet\nOh yeah\n\n"}
