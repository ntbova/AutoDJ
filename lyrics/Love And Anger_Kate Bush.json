{"song": "Love And Anger", "artist": "Kate Bush", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt lay buried here\nIt lay deep inside me\nIt's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it\nIt could take me all of my life\nBut it would only take a moment to\nTell you what I'm feeling, but I don't know if I'm ready yet\nYou come walking into this room\nLike you're walking into my arms\nAnd what would I do without you?\n\n[Chorus]\nTake away the love and the anger\nAnd a little piece of hope holding us together\nLooking for a moment that'll never happen\nLiving in the gap between past and future\nTake away the stone and the timber\nAnd a little piece of rope won't hold it together\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you can't tell your sister\nIf you can't tell a priest\n'Cause it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it to anyone\nCan you tell it to your heart?\nCan you find it in your heart\nTo let go of these feelings like a bell to a southerly wind?\nWe could be like two strings beating\nSpeaking in sympathy\n\"What would we do without you?\"\nTwo strings speak in sympathy\n\"What would we do without you?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nTake away the love and the anger\nAnd a little piece of hope holding us together\nLooking for a moment that'll never happen\nLiving in the gap between past and future\nTake away the stone and the timber\nAnd a little piece of rope won't hold it together\nWe're building a house of the future together\n\"What would we do without you?\"\n\n[Interlude]\nMmh, yeah\nMmh, yeah\nMmh, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it\nJust remember to reach out and touch the past and the future\nWell, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it\nDon't ever think that you can't change the past and the future\nMmh, yeah\n\"What would we do without you?\"\n\n[Outro]\nYou might not\nNot think so now\nBut just you wait and see\nSomeone will come to help you\nMmh, yeah\nMmh, yeah\nMmh, mmh, mmh, yeah\n\n"}
