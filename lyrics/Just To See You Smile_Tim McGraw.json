{"song": "Just To See You Smile", "artist": "Tim McGraw", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou always had an eye for things that glittered\nBut I was far from bein' made of gold\nI don't know how but I scraped up the money\nI just never could quite tell you no\nJust like when you were leavin' Amarillo\nTakin' that new job in Tennessee\nAnd I quit mine so we could be together\nI can't forget the way you looked at me\n\n[Chorus]\nJust to see you smile\nI'd do anything, that you wanted me to\nWhen all is said and done\nI'd never count the cost\nIt's worth all that's lost\nJust to see you smile\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you said time was all you really needed\nI walked away and let you have your space\n'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly\nAs the tears I saw rollin' down your face\nAnd yesterday I knew just what you wanted\nWhen you came walkin' up to me with him\nSo I told you that I was happy for you\nAnd given the chance I'd lie again\n\n[Chorus]\nJust to see you smile\nI'd do anything, that you wanted me to\nWhen all is said and done\nI'd never count the cost\nIt's worth all that's lost\nJust to see you smile\n\n[Chorus]\nJust to see you smile\nI'd do anything, that you wanted me to\nWhen all is said and done\nI'd never count the cost\nIt's worth all that's lost\nJust to see you smile\n\n"}
