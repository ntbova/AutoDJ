{"song": "You Found Me", "artist": "The Fray", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI found God on the corner of First and Amistad\nWhere the west was all but won\nAll alone smoking his last cigarette\nI said, \"Where you been?\" He said, \"Ask anything\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere were you when everything was falling apart?\nAll my days were spent by a telephone\nThat never rang and all I needed was a call\nThat never came to the corner of First and Amistad\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure, you found me, you found me\nLying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn the end, everyone ends up alone\nLosing her, the only one who's ever known\nWho I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be\nNo way to know how long she will be next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure, you found me, you found me\nLying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Bridge]\nEarly morning the city breaks and I've been calling for years and years and years and years\nAnd you never left me no messages, you never send me no letters\nYou got some kind of nerve taking all I want\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLost and insecure, you found me, you found me\nLying on the floor, where were you, where were you?\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure, you found me, you found me\nLying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Outro]\nWhy'd you have to wait to find me, to find me?\n\n"}
