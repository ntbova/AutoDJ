{"song": "Too Busy Thinking About My Baby", "artist": "Marvin Gaye", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nAh-ah-aaah, oh yeah\nOh listen to me people\n\n[Verse 1]\nI haven't got time to think about money\nOr what it can buy\nAnd I haven't got time to sit down and wonder\nWhat makes a birdie fly\nAnd I don't have the time to think about\nWhat makes a flower grow\nAnd I've never given a second thought\nTo where the rivers flow\n\n[Chorus]\nToo busy thinking about my baby\nAnd I haven't got time for nothing else\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaid, I haven't got time to discuss the weather\nHow long it's going to last\nAnd I haven't got time to do no studies\nOnce I get out of class\nTelling you I'm just a fellow\nSaid I got a one track mind\nAnd when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby\nI just don't have any time\n\n[Chorus]\nToo busy thinking about my baby\nAnd I haven't got time for nothing else\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe diamonds and pearls in the world\nCould never match her worth, no no\nShe's some kind of wonderful, people tell you\nI got heaven right here on earth\nI'm just a fellow\nWith a one, one track mind\nAnd when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby\nI just don't have any time\n\n[Chorus]\nToo busy thinking about my baby\nAnd I haven't got time for nothing else\n\n[Outro]\n(Yeah, she's never hard to find\nBecause she's always on my mind)\n\n"}
