{"song": "A Holly Jolly Christmas", "artist": "Burl Ives", "lyrics": "\n\nHave a holly, jolly Christmas;\nIt's the best time of the year\nI don't know if there'll be snow\nBut have a cup of cheer\nHave a holly, jolly Christmas;\nAnd when you walk down the street\nSay Hello to friends you know\nAnd everyone you meet\nOh, ho, the mistletoe\nHung where you can see;\nSomebody waits for you;\nKiss her once for me\nHave a holly jolly Christmas\nAnd in case you didn't hear\nOh by golly, have a holly\nJolly Christmas this year\n\n"}
