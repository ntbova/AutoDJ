{"song": "Blurry", "artist": "Puddle Of Mudd", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nEverything's so blurry and everyone's so fake\nAnd everybody's empty and everything is so messed up\nPreoccupied, without you I cannot live at all\nMy whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou could be my someone, you could be my scene\nYou know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene\nI wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are\nThere's oceans in between us, but that's not very far\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you take it all away\nCan you take it all away\nWhen you shoved it in my face\nThis pain you gave to me\nCan you take it all away\nCan you take it all away\nWhen you shoved it in my face?\n\n[Verse 3]\nEveryone is changing, there's no one left that's real\nSo make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel\nCause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all\nMy whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd you could be my someone, you could be my scene\nYou know that I will save you from all of the unclean\nI wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are\nThere's oceans in between us, but that's not very far\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you take it all away\nCan you take it all away\nWhen you shoved it in my face\nThis pain you gave to me\nCan you take it all away\nCan you take it all away\nWhen you shoved it in my face\nThis pain you gave to me?\n\n[Bridge]\nNo-nobody told me what you thought\nNobody told me what to say\nEveryone showed you where to turn\nTold you when to run away\nNobody told you where to hide\nNobody told you what to say\nEveryone showed you where to turn\nShowed you when to run away\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you take it all away\nCan you take it all away\nWhen you shoved it in my face\nThis pain you gave to me\nCan you take it all away\nCan you take it all away\nWhen you shoved it in my face\nThis pain you gave to me\nNo, this pain you gave to me\nThis pain you gave to me?\n\n[Outro]\nCan you take it all\nCan you take it all away\nThe pain you gave to me\nThis pain you gave to me\nThis pain you gave to me\nTake it all away\nThis pain you gave to me...\n\n"}
