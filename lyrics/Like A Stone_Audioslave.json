{"song": "Like A Stone", "artist": "Audioslave", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness\nBy a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages\nOf a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone\nAnd if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go\n\n[Chorus]\nIn your house, I long to be\nRoom by room, patiently\nI'll wait for you there, like a stone\nI'll wait for you there, alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels\nLike a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven\nTo a place I recall, I was there so long ago\nThe sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on\n\n[Chorus]\nIn your house, I long to be\nRoom by room, patiently\nI'll wait for you there, like a stone\nI'll wait for you there, alone, alone\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd on I read, until the day was gone\nAnd I sat in regret of all the things I've done\nFor all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged\nIn dreams until my death, I will wander on\n\n[Chorus]\nIn your house, I long to be\nRoom by room, patiently\nI'll wait for you there, like a stone\nI'll wait for you there, alone, alone\n\n"}
