{"song": "Mysterious Ways", "artist": "U2", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nJohnny, take a walk with your sister the moon\nLet her pale light in, to fill up your room\nYou've been living underground, eating from a can\nYou've been running away from what you don't understand, love\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe's slippy, you're sliding down\nShe'll be there when you hit the ground\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright\nShe moves in mysterious ways\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright\nShe moves in mysterious ways, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nJohnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain\nLet her talk about the things you can't explain\nTo touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal\nIf you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel\nOn your knees, boy!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe's the wave, she turns the tide\nShe sees the man inside the child\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright\nShe moves in mysterious ways, oh\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright\nShe moves in mysterious ways, oh\n\nLift my days, light up my nights, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nOne day you'll look back, and you'll see\nWhere you were held now by this love\nWhile you could stand there\nYou could move on this moment\nFollow this feeling\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright\nShe moves in mysterious ways\nIt's alright, it's alright, it's alright\nShe moves in mysterious ways, oh\n\n[Outro]\nMove you, spirits move you\nMove, spirits 'its move you, oh yeah\nDoes it move you?\nShe moves with it\nLift my days, and light up my nights, oh\nWe move through miracle days\nSpirit moves in mysterious ways\nShe moves with it\nShe moves with it\nLift my days, light up my nights\n\n"}
