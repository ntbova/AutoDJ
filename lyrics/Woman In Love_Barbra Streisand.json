{"song": "Woman In Love", "artist": "Barbra Streisand", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nLife is a moment in space\nWhen the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place\nI kissed the morning goodbye\nBut down inside you know we never know why\nThe road is narrow and long\nWhen eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong\nI turn away from the wall\nI stumble and fall but I give you it all\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a woman In Love and I do anything\n(I am a Woman In Love and I do anything)\nTo get you into my world and hold you within\n(To get you into my world and hold you within)\nIt's a right, I defend\nOver and over again\n(Over and over again)\nWhat do I do\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith you eternally mine\nIn love there is no measure of time\nWe planned it all at the start\nThat you and I live in each other's heart\nWe may be oceans away\nYou feel my love, I hear what you say\nNo truth is ever a lie\nI stumble and fall but I give you it all\n\n[Chorus]\n(I am a woman In Love and I do anything)\n(To get you into my world and hold you within)\nAnd hold you within\nIt's a right, I defend\nOver and over again\n(Over and over again)\nWhat do I do\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nI am a Woman In Love and I'm talking to you\n(I am a Woman In Love and I'm talking to you)\nYou know I know how you feel, what a woman can do\n(You know I know how you feel, what a woman can do)\nIt's a right, I defend\nOver and over again\n(Over and over again)\n(I am a Woman In Love and I do anything)\nAnd I do anything\nTo get you into my world and hold you within\n(To get you into my world and hold you within)\nIt's a right, I defend\nOver and over again\n(Over and over again)\n\n"}
