{"song": "God Gave Me You", "artist": "Blake Shelton", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've been a walking heartache\nI've made a mess of me\nThe person that I've been lately\nAren\u2019t who I want to be\n\nBut you stay here right beside me\nWatch as the storm blows through\nAnd I need you\n\n[Chorus]\nCause God gave me you for the ups and downs\nGod gave me you for the days of doubt\nAnd for when I think I've lost my way\nThere are no words here left to say, it's true\nGod gave me you\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's more here than what we\u2019re seeing\nA divine conspiracy\nThat you, an angel lovely\nCould somehow fall for me\nYou'll always be love's great martyr\nAnd I'll be the flattered fool\nAnd I need you\nYeah!\n\n[Chorus]\nGod gave me you for the ups and downs\nGod gave me you for the days of doubt\nAnd for when I think I've lost my way\nThere are no words here left to say, it's true\nGod gave me you\n\n[Verse 3]\nOn my own I'm only\nHalf of what I could be\nI can't do without you\nWe are stitched together\nAnd what love has tethered\nI pray we never undo\n\n[Chorus]\nCause God gave me you for the ups and downs\nGod gave me you for the days of doubt\nGod gave me you for the ups and downs\nGod gave me you for the days of doubt\nAnd for when I think I've lost my way\nThere are no words here left to say, it's true\nGod gave me you, gave me you\nHe gave me you\n\n"}
