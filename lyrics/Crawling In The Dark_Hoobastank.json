{"song": "Crawling In The Dark", "artist": "Hoobastank", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI will dedicate and sacrifice my every\nThing for just a second's worth of how my story's ending\nAnd I wish I could know if the directions that I take\nAnd all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing\n\n[Chorus]\nShow me what it's for, make me understand it\nI've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer\nIs there something more than what I've been handed?\nI've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer\n\n[Verse 2]\nHelp me carry on, assure me it's ok to\nUse my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness\nWill the ending be ever coming suddenly?\nWill I ever get to see the ending to my story?\n\n[Chorus]\nShow me what it's for, make me understand it\nI've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer\nIs there something more than what I've been handed?\nI've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer\n\n[Rap]\nSo when and how will I know?\n\n[Bridge]\nHow much further do I have to go?\nAnd how much longer 'til I finally know?\n`Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me\nIn front of me\n\n[Chorus]\nShow me what it's for, make me understand it\nI've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer\nIs there something more than what I've been handed?\nI've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer\n\n"}
