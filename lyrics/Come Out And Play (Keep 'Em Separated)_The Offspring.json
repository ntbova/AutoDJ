{"song": "Come Out And Play (Keep 'Em Separated)", "artist": "The Offspring", "lyrics": "\n\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\n\n[Verse 1]\nLike the latest fashion\nLike a spreading disease\nThe kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom\nGetting weapons with the greatest of ease\nThe gangs stake out their own campus locale\nAnd if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal\nIf one guy's colors and the other's don't mix\nThey're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Man, you talkin' back to me?\nTake him out\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\nHey! Man, you disrespectin' me?\nTake him out\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\nHey, they don't pay no mind\nIf you're under 18, you won't be doing any time\nHey! Come out and play\n\n[Verse 2]\nBy the time you hear the siren\nIt's already too late\nOne goes to the morgue and the other to jail\nOne guy's wasted and the other's a waste\nIt goes down the same as the thousand before\nNo one's getting smarter\nNo one's learning the score\nYour never ending spree of death and violence and hate\nIs gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Man, you disrespectin' me?\nTake him out\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\nHey! Man, you talkin' back to me?\nTake him out\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\nHey, they don't pay no mind\nIf you're under 18, you won't be doing any time\nHey! Come out and play\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt goes down the same as the thousand before\nNo one's getting smarter\nNo one's learning the score\nYour never ending spree of death and violence and hate\nIs gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Man, you talkin' back to me?\nTake him out\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\nHey! Man, you disrespectin' me?\nTake him out\nYou gotta keep 'em separated\nHey, they don't pay no mind\nIf you're under 18, you won't be doing any time\nHey! Come out and play\n\n"}
