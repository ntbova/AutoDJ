{"song": "I Know What It's Like", "artist": "Jeff Tweedy", "lyrics": "\n\nFar away\nFrom the fireworks display\nQuiet and bright\n\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel love\n\nWhen a sunny day\nStarts to rain\nKeep me in mind\n\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel love\n\nEven when I'm wide awake\nI keep turning back one page\nI can't find the plot\nSomething else is taking shape\nI know what it's like\nTo keep losing your place\n\nMy shadow stays\nEven when I'm miles away\nWaiting outside\n\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel pain\n\nWhen the lights are dim\nIn my window I have a twin\nI'm always looking out\nAnd he's always looking in\nI know what it's like\nStarting over again\n\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel love\n\nFar away\nFrom the fireworks display\nQuiet and bright\n\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel love\n\nEven when it's years away\nI still think it's yesterday\nI can't find the plot\nSomething else is taking shape\nI know it's a lie\nWhen you say it's okay\n\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel love\n\nI know what it's like\nTo not feel love\n\n"}
