{"song": "Here Without You", "artist": "3 Doors Down", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nA hundred days have made me older\nSince the last time that I saw your pretty face\nA thousand lies have made me colder\nAnd I don't think I can look at this the same\nBut all the miles that separate\nDisappear now when I'm dreaming of your face\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\nI think about you, baby\nAnd I dream about you all the time\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\nAnd tonight, it's only you and me, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe miles just keep rolling\nAs the people leave their way to say hello\nI've heard this life is overrated\nBut I hope that it gets better as we go\nOh yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\nI think about you, baby\nAnd I dream about you all the time\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\nAnd tonight it's only you and me, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nEverything I know, and anywhere I go\nIt gets hard, but it won't take away my love\nAnd when the last one falls\nWhen it's all said and done\nIt gets hard, but it won't take away my love\nWhoa, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\nI think about you, baby\nAnd I dream about you all the time\nI'm here without you, baby\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\nAnd tonight, girl, it's only you and me\n\n"}
