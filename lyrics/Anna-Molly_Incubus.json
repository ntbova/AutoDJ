{"song": "Anna-Molly", "artist": "Incubus", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nA cloud hangs over this city by the sea\nI watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be\nOut there and sober as well from loneliness\nPlease do persist, girl it's time we met and made a mess\n\n[Chorus]\nI picture your face at the back of my eyes\nA fire in the attic, proof of the prize\nAnna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly\n\n[Verse 2]\nA cloud hangs over and mutes my happiness\nA thousand ships couldn't sail me back from distress\nWish you were here I'm a wounded satellite\nI need you here, put me back together, make me right\n\n[Chorus]\nI picture your face at the back of my eyes\nA fire in the attic, proof of the prize\nAnna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly\nI'm calling your name up into the air\nNot one of the others could ever compare!\nAnna-Molly, Anna-Molly!\n\n[Bridge]\nWait, there is a light\nThere is a fire\nIlluminated attic\nFate, or something better\nI could care less\nJust stay with me a while\nWait, there is a light\nThere is a fire\nDe-fragmenting the attic\nFate, or something better\nI could care less\nJust stay with me a while, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI picture your face at the back of my eyes\nA fire in the attic, proof of the prize\nAnna-Molly, Anna-Molly, Anna-Molly\n\nI'm calling your name up into the air\nNot one of the others could ever compare!\nAnna-Molly, Anna-Molly!\n\n[Outro]\n(Wait, there is a light\nThere is a fire) Anna-Molly!\n(De-fragmenting the attic)\n(Fate, or something better\nI could care less) Anna-Molly!\n(Just stay with me a while, oh)\n\n"}
