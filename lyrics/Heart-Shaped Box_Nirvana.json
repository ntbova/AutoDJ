Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nYour advice\n\n[Verse 2]\nMeat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet\nCut myself on angel hair and baby's breath\nBroken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black\nThrow down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nYour advice\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak\nI've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\nI've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap\nI wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nYour advice\nYour advice\nYour advice\n\n"}
