Please?\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, no, no, no\nI don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)\nNothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do\nJust want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you\n\n[Outro]\n(Fa la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la)\nJust you and me, under a tree\n(Fa la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la la)\nA cozy little Christmas here with you\n\n"}
