King] x 2\nI've been downhearted baby\nI've been down-\nI've been downhearted baby\nEver since the day we met\nEver since the day we met\n\n[Verse 1: Chris O'Connor]\nJan lays down and wrestles in her sleep\nMoonlight spills on comic books\nAnd superstars in magazines\nAn old friend calls and tells us where to meet\nHer plane takes off from Baltimore\nAnd touches down on Bourbon Street\n\n[Verse 2: Chris O'Connor]\nWe sit outside and argue all night long\nAbout a god we've never seen\nBut never fails to side with me\nSunday comes and all the papers say\nMa Teresa's joined the mob\nAnd happy with her full time job\n\n[Chorus: B.B. King] x 2\n\n[Verse 3: Chris O'Connor]\nAm I alive or thoughts that drift away?\nDoes summer come for everyone?\nCan humans do as prophets say?\nAnd if I die before I learn to speak\nCan money pay for all the days I lived awake\nBut half asleep?\n\n[Verse 4: Chris O'Connor]\nA life is time, they teach you growing up\nThe seconds ticking killed us all\nA million years before the fall\nYou ride the waves and don't ask where they go\nYou swim like lions through the crest\nAnd bathe yourself in zebra flesh\n\n[Outro: Chris O'Connor]\nI've been downhearted baby\nI've been downhearted baby\nEver since the day we met\n\n[Chorus: B.B. King] x 7\n\n"}
