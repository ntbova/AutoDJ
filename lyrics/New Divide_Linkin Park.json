{"song": "New Divide", "artist": "Linkin Park", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remembered black skies\nThe lightning all around me\nI remembered each flash\nAs time began to blur\nLike a startling sign\nThat fate had finally found me\nAnd your voice was all I heard\nThat I get what I deserve\n\n[Chorus]\nSo give me reason\nTo prove me wrong\nTo wash this memory clean\nLet the floods cross\nThe distance in your eyes\nGive me reason\nTo fill this hole\nConnect this space between\nLet it be enough to reach the truth that lies\nAcross this new divide\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere was nothing in sight\nBut memories left abandoned\nThere was nowhere to hide\nThe ashes fell like snow\nAnd the ground caved in\nBetween where we were standing\nAnd your voice was all I heard\nThat I get what I deserve\n\n[Chorus]\nSo give me reason\nTo prove me wrong\nTo wash this memory clean\nLet the floods cross\nThe distance in your eyes\nAcross this new divide\n\n[Bridge]\nIn every loss in every lie\nIn every truth that you deny\nAnd each regret and each goodbye\nWas a mistake too great to hide\nAnd your voice was all I heard\nThat I get what I deserve\n\n[Chorus]\nSo give me reason\nTo prove me wrong\nTo wash this memory clean\nLet the floods cross\nThe distance in your eyes\nGive me reason\nTo fill this hole\nConnect this space between\nLet it be enough to reach the truth that lies\nAcross this new divide\nAcross this new divide\nAcross this new divide\n\n"}
