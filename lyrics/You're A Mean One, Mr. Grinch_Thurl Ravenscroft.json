{"song": "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch", "artist": "Thurl Ravenscroft", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou're a mean one, Mr. Grinch\nYou really are a heel\nYou're as cuddly as a cactus\nYou're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch\nYou're a bad banana\nWith a greasy black peel\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're a monster, Mr. Grinch\nYour heart's an empty hole\nYour brain is full of spiders\nYou've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch\nI wouldn't touch you\nWith a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're a vile one, Mr. Grinch\nYou have termites in your smile\nYou have all the tender sweetness\nOf a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch\nGiven the choice between the two of you\nI'd take the seasick crocodile\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou're a foul one, Mr. Grinch\nYou're a nasty, wasty skunk\nYour heart is full of unwashed socks\nYour soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch\nThe three words that best describe you\nAre as follows, and I quote:\n\"Stink. Stank. Stunk.\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou're a rotter, Mr. Grinch\nYou're the king of sinful sots\nYour heart's a dead tomato splotched\nWith moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch\nYour soul is an appalling dump heap\nOverflowing with the most disgraceful assortment\nOf deplorable rubbish imaginable\nMangled up in tangled-up knots\n\n[Verse 6]\nYou nauseate me, Mr. Grinch\nWith a nauseous super-naus\nYou're a crooked, jerky jockey\nAnd you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch\nYou're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich\nWith arsenic sauce\n\n"}
