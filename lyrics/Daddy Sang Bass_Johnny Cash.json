{"song": "Daddy Sang Bass", "artist": "Johnny Cash", "lyrics": "\n\nI remember when I was a lad\nTimes were hard and things were bad\nBut there's a silver lining behind every cloud\nJust poor people, that's all we were\nTrying to make a living out of black land dirt\nWe'd get together in a family circle singing loud\n\nDaddy sang bass\nMama sang tenor\nMe and little brother would join right in there\nSinging seems to help a troubled soul\nOne of these days and it won't be long\nI'll rejoin them in a song\nI'm going to join the family circle at the throne\nNo, the circle won't be broken\nBy and by, Lord, by and by\n\nDaddy sang bass\nMama sang tenor\nMe and little brother would join right in there\nIn the sky, Lord, in the sky\n\nNow I remember after work\nMama would call in all of us\nYou could hear us singing for a country mile\nNow little brother has done gone on\nBut, I'll rejoin him in a song\nWe'll be together again up yonder in a little while\n\nDaddy sang bass\nMama sang tenor\nMe and little brother would join right in there\nIn the sky, Lord, in the sky\n\nDaddy sang bass\nMama sang tenor\nMe and little brother would join right in there\nIn the sky, Lord, in the sky\n\nSongwriter:  Carl Perkins\n\n"}
