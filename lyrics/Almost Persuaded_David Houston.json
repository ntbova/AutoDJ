{"song": "Almost Persuaded", "artist": "David Houston", "lyrics": "\n\nLast night all alone in a barroom\nMet a girl with a drink in her hand\nShe had ruby red lips, coal black hair\nAnd eyes that would tempt any man\n\nThen she came and sat down at my table\nAnd as she placed her soft hands in mine\nI found myself wanting to kiss her\nFor temptation was flowing like wine\n\nAnd I was almost persuaded\nTo strip myself of my pride\nAlmost persuaded\nTo push my conscience aside\n\nThen we danced and she whispered, \"I need you\"\n\"Take me away from here and be my man\"\nThen I've looked into her eyes and I saw it\nThe reflection of my wedding band\n\nAnd I was almost persuaded\nTo let strange lips lead me on\nAlmost persuaded\nBut your sweet love made me stop and go home\n\n"}
