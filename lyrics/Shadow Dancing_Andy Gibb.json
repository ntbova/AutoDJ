{"song": "Shadow Dancing", "artist": "Andy Gibb", "lyrics": "\n\nYou got me looking at that heaven in your eyes\nI was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies\nAnd I was loving you\nWhen the words are said, baby, I lose my head\n\nAnd in a world of people, there's only you and I\nThere ain't nothing come between us in the end\nHow can I hold you when you ain't even mine?\nOnly you can see me through\nI leave it up to you\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\nAll that I need is just one moment in your arms\nI was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm\nAnd I was loving you\nMake it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way\n\nI need that sweet sensation of living in your love\nI can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down\nYou are the question and the answer am I\nOnly you can see me through\nI leave it up to you\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\nAnd in this world of people, there's only you and I\nThere ain't nothing come between us in the end\nHow can I hold you when you ain't even mine?\nOnly you can see me through\nI leave it up to you, oh\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\nDo it light, taking me through the night\nShadow dancing, baby you do it right\nGive me more, drag me across the floor\nShadow dancing, all this and nothing more\n\n"}
