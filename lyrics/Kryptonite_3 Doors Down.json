{"song": "Kryptonite", "artist": "3 Doors Down", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind\nI left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time\nBut I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon\nI feel there's nothing I can do, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI watched the world float to the dark side of the moon\nAfter all I knew, it had to be something to do with you\nI really don't mind what happens now and then\nAs long as you'll be my friend at the end\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?\nI'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might\nKryptonite\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou called me strong, you called me weak\nBut still your secrets, I will keep\nYou took for granted all the times, I never let you down\nYou stumbled in and bumped your head\nIf not for me then you'd be dead\nI picked you up and put you back on solid ground\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?\nI'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might\nKryptonite\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?\nI'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might\nKryptonite, yeah\nIf I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?\nI'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might\nKryptonite\n\n[Outro]\nAll around the world\nAll around the world\nAll around the world\n\n"}
