{"song": "Please Come Home For Christmas", "artist": "Eagles", "lyrics": "\n\nBells will be ringing this sad, sad news\nOh, what a Christmas to have the blues\nMy baby's gone, I have no friends\nTo wish me greetings once again\nChoirs will be singing \"Silent Night\"\nChristmas carols by candlelight\nPlease come home for Christmas\nPlease come home for Christmas\nIf not for Christmas, by New Year's night\nFriends and relations send salutations\nSure as the stars shine above\nBut this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear\nThe time of year to be with the ones you love\nSo won't you tell me you'll never more roam\nChristmas and New Year's will find you home\nThere will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain\nAnd I'll be happy, happy once again\n\nOoh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain\nAnd I'll be happy, Christmas once again\n\n"}
