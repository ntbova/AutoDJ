{"song": "White Christmas", "artist": "The Drifters", "lyrics": "\n\nOoh\nDoop doop, doop doo doop\nOoh\nDoop doop, doop doo doop\n\nI'm dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know\nWhere those treetops glisten, and children listen\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow\n\nThen, I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\nMay your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\n\nI-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas\nJust like the ones I used to know\nWhere the treetops glisten, and children listen\nTo hear sleigh bells in the snow\n\nI-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas\nWith every Christmas card I write\nMay your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright\nAnd may all your Christmases be white\n\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells all the way\nOoooh\n\n"}
