{"song": "Straight Up", "artist": "Paula Abdul", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nLost in a dream\nI don't know which way to go\n(A-let me say it now)\nIf you are all that you seem\nThen, baby, I'm movin' way too slow\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught\nIn the slammin' door\nHow about some information, please?\n\n[Chorus]\nStraight up now, tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever (oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nStraight up now, tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together (oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?\n\n[Verse 2]\nTime's standing still\nWaiting for some small clue\n(A-let me tell ya now)\nI keep getting chills\nWhen I think your love is true\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught\nIn the slammin' door\nHow about some information, please?\n\n[Chorus]\nStraight up now, tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever (oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nStraight up now, tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together (oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?\n\n[Bridge]\nYou are so hard to read\nYou play hide-and-seek\nWith your true intentions\nIf you're only playin' games\nI'll just have to say\nAbb-b-b-bye, b-b-b-bye\n\n[Breakdown]\nDo, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me, baby?)\nDo, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me? A-hey, baby!)\nDo, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me, baby?)\nC'mon now, do, do you love me?\n(Do, do you love me?)\nA-tell me, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus - Extended]\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love\nCaught in the slammin' door\nAre you more than hot for me\nOr am I a page in your history book?\nI don't mean to make demands\nBut the word and the deed go hand in hand\nHow about some information, please?\n\n[Chorus]\nStraight up now, tell me\nDo you really wanna love me forever (oh, oh, oh)\nOr am I caught in a hit-and-run?\nStraight up now, tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together (oh, oh, oh)\nOr are you just havin' fun?\n\n"}
