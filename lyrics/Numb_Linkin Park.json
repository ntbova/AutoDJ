{"song": "Numb", "artist": "Linkin Park", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]\nI'm tired of being what you want me to be\nFeeling so faithless, lost under the surface\nI don't know what you're expecting of me\nPut under the pressure of walking in your shoes\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]\nCaught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you\nCaught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI've become so numb, I can't feel you there\nBecome so tired, so much more aware\nI'm becoming this, all I want to do\nIs be more like me and be less like you!\n\n[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]\nCan't you see that you're smothering me?\nHolding too tightly, afraid to lose control\n'Cause everything that you thought I would be\nHas fallen apart, right in front of you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]\nCaught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you\nCaught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow\nAnd every second I waste is more than I can take\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI've become so numb, I can't feel you there\nBecome so tired, so much more aware\nI'm becoming this, all I want to do\nIs be more like me and be less like you\n\n[Bridge: Chester Bennington]\nAnd I know I may end up failing, too\nBut I know you were just like me\nWith someone disappointed in you\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nI've become so numb, I can't feel you there\nBecome so tired, so much more aware\nI'm becoming this, all I want to do\nIs be more like me and be less like you\n\n[Outro: Chester Bennington]\nI've become so numb, I can't feel you there\nI'm tired of being what you want me to be\nI've become so numb, I can't feel you there\nI'm tired of being what you want me to be\n\n"}
