{"song": "What I Got", "artist": "Sublime", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nEarly in the mornin', risin' to the street\nLight me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet\nGot to find the reason, reason things went wrong\nGot to find a reason why my money's all gone\nI got a dalmatian and I can still get high\nI can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot\n\nWell, life is (too short), so love the one you got\n'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot\nNever start no static, I just get it off my chest\nNever had to battle with no bulletproof vest\nTake a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me\nTake all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty\nLove is what I got, it's within my reach\nAnd the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach\nIt all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve\nTry and test that, you're bound to get served\nLove's what I got, don't start a riot\nYou feel it when the dance gets hot\n\n[Chorus]\nLovin' is what I got\nI said, remember that\nLovin' is what I got\nAnd remember that\nLovin' is what I got\nI said, remember that\nLovin' is what I got\nI got, I got, I got\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy I don't cry when my dog runs away\nI don't get angry at the bills I have to pay\nI don't get angry when my mom smokes pot\nHits the bottle and goes right to the rock\nFuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same\nLiving with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane\nLet the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me\n\n[Chorus]\nLovin' is what I got\nI said, remember that\nLovin' is what I got\nAnd remember that\nLovin' is what I got\nI said remember that\nLovin' is what I got\n(I got, I got, I got)\n\n"}
