{"song": "Every Morning", "artist": "Sugar Ray", "lyrics": "\n\n[Intro]\nEvery morning there's a halo hanging\nFrom the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed\nI know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for\nThe weekend or a one-night stand\n\n[Verse 1]\nCouldn't understand\nHow to work it out\nOnce again, as predicted, left my broken heart open\nAnd you ripped it out\nSomething's got me reeling\nStopped me from believing\nTurn me around again\nSaid that we can do it\nYou know I wanna do it again\n\n[Chorus]\n(Sugar Ray say)\nOhh\n(Every morning)\nOhh\n(Every morning when I wake up)\n(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)\nOhh\n(She always rights the wrong, she always rights, she always rights)\n(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery morning there's a heartache hanging\nFrom the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed\nI know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me\nBut I never can believe what she said\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSomething so deceiving, when you stop believing\nTurn me around again\nSaid we couldn't do it\nYou know I wanna do it again\n\n[Chorus]\nOhh\n(Every morning)\nOhh\n(Every morning when I wake up)\n(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)\nOhh\n(Every morning)\n(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)\n\n[Bridge]\nShe always rights the wrong\nFor me\nBaby\nShe always rights the wrong\nFor me\n\n[Verse 3]\nEvery morning there's a halo hanging\nFrom the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed\nI know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for\nThe weekend or a one-night stand\n\n[Chorus]\n(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)\nEvery morning\nEvery morning when I wake up\n(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)\nEvery morning\nEvery morning (Turn me around again)\nEvery morning (Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)\nEvery morning (Do it again)\nEvery morning when I wake up\nEvery morning\n\n"}
