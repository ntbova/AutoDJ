{"song": "If Only You Knew", "artist": "Patti LaBelle", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI must have rehearsed my lines\nA thousand times\nUntil I had them memorized\n\nBut when I get up the nerve\nTo tell you the words\nJust never seem to come out right\n\n[Chorus]\nIf only you knew\nHow much I do\nDo love you\n\nIf only you knew\nHow much I do\nI do need you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI dream of moments we share\nBut you're not there\nI'm living in a fantasy\n\nCause you don't even suspect\nCould probably care less\nAbout the changes I been going through\n\n[Chorus]\nIf only you knew\nHow much I do\nDo love you\n\nIf only you knew\nHow much I do\nI do need you\n\n[Bridge]\nNo, you don't even suspect\nCould probably care less\nAbout the changes I been going through\n\n[Chorus & ad libs until song ends.]\n\n"}
