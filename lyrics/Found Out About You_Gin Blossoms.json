{"song": "Found Out About You", "artist": "Gin Blossoms", "lyrics": "\n\nAll last summer in case you don't recall\nI was yours and you were mine forget it all\nIs there a line that I could write\nThat's sad enough to make you cry?\nAnd all the lines you wrote to me were lies\n\nMonths roll past, the love that you struck dead\nDid you love me only in my head?\nThere were things you said and did to me\nThey seem to come so easily\nThe love I thought I'd won you give for free\n\nWhispers at the bus stop\nWell I've heard about nights out in the school yard\nI found out about you\nI found out about you\n\nRumors follow everywhere you go\nLike when you left and I was last to know\nWell you're famous now and there's no doubt\nIn all the places you hang out\nThey know your name and they know what you're about\n\nWhispers at the bus stop\nWell I've heard about nights out in the school yard\nI found out about you\nI found out about you\n\nStreet lights blink on through the car window\nI get the time too often on AM radio\nWell you know it's all I think about\nI write your name, drive past your house\nYour boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out\n\nWhispers at the bus stop\nWell I've heard about nights out in the school yard\nI found out about you\nI found out about you\n\nWhispers at the bus stop\nWell I've heard about nights out in the school yard\nI found out about you\nI found out about you\n\nI found about you\n\n"}
