Don't listen to a word I say\nHey! The screams all sound the same\nHey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our\nBodies safe to shore\n\n[Refrain: Nanna & Ragnar]\nHey!\nHey!\nHey!\n\n[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]\nYou're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear\nAll that's left is a ghost of you\nNow we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do\nJust let me go, we'll meet again soon\n\nNow wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around\nI'll see you when I fall asleep\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]\nHey! Don't listen to a word I say\nHey! The screams all sound the same\nHey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our\nBodies safe to shore\n\n[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]\nHey! Don't listen to a word I say\nHey! The screams all sound the same\nHey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our\nBodies safe to shore\n\n[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]\nThough the truth may vary, this ship will carry our\nBodies safe to shore...\n\n"}
