{"song": "The Mayor Of Simpleton", "artist": "XTC", "lyrics": "\n\nNever been near a university\nNever took a paper or a learned degree\nAnd some of your friends think that's stupid of me\nBut it's nothing that I care about\n\nWell, I don't know how to tell the weight of the sun\nAnd of mathematics well, I want none\nAnd I may be the mayor of simpleton\nBut I know one thing and that's I love you\n\nWhen their logic grows cold and all thinking gets done\nYou'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of simpleton\n\nI can't have been there when brains were handed round\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nOr get past the cover of your books profound\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nAnd some of your friends thinks it's really unsound\nThat you're ever seen talking to me\n\nWell, I don't know how to write a big hit song\nAnd all crossword puzzles, well I just shun\nAnd I may be the mayor of simpleton\nBut I know one thing and that's I love you\n\nI'm not proud of the fact that I never learned much\nJust feel I should say\nWhat you get is all real, I can't put on an act\nIt takes brains to do that anyway\n\nAnd anyway\nAnd I can't unravel riddles problems and puns\nHow the home computer has me on the run\nAnd I may be the mayor of simpleton\nBut I know one thing and that's I love you, I love you\n\nIf depth of feeling is a currency\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nThen I'm the man who grew the money tree\nNo change of office and no hope of getting one\nSome of your friends are too brainy to see\nThat they're paupers and that's how they'll stay\n\nWell, I don't know how many pounds make up a ton\nOf all the Nobel prizes that I've never won\nAnd I may be the mayor of simpleton\nBut I know one thing and that's I love you, I love you\n\nWhen all logic grows cold and all thinking gets done\nYou'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of simpleton\nYou'll be warm in the arms of the mayor of simpleton\nYou'll be warm in the arms of the mayor\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\nPlease be upstanding for the mayor of simpleton\n\n"}
