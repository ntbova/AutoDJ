{"song": "Neon Church", "artist": "Tim McGraw", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nI need Jesus or I need whiskey\nWhatever works best to get me through\nGettin' over you\n\n[Verse 2]\nA little Friday night hallelujah\nA congregation of backsliders just like me\nYeah, what I need\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIs a neon church\nWith a jukebox choir\nFull of honky tonk angels\nWith their wings on fire\nStraight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'\nI got a feelin'\nI need a neon church\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaptize me in that barroom smoke\nBartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more\nAin't that what this place is for?\n\n[Verse 4]\nI tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'\nBut damn did that hurt don't just keep hangin' around\nWhat I need right now\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIs a neon church\nWith a jukebox choir\nFull of honky tonk angels\nWith their wings on fire\nStraight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'\nI got a feelin'\nI need a neon church\n\n[Bridge]\nJust a-sippin' down that unholy water\nSave that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow\nI'll stay here all night\n\n[Chorus 2]\nIn a neon church\nWith the party crowd\nWhere the good times roll\nAnd the music's loud\nInstead of home starin' holes in the ceiling\nI got a feeling\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI need a neon church\nWith a jukebox choir\nFull of honky tonk angels\nWith their wings on fire\nStraight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'\nI got a feelin'\nI need a neon church\nI need a neon church\n\n"}
