{"song": "Baby It's Cold Outside", "artist": "Dean Martin", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]\nI really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nI've got to away (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nThis evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)\nSo very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)\nMy mother will start worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)\nMy father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)\nSo really I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)\nBut maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)\nThe neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)\nSay, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)\nI wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)\nTo break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)\nI ought to say \"No, no, no, sir\" (Mind if I move in closer?)\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)\n\n[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]\nI really can't stay\n(Oh, baby, don't hold out)\nBaby, it's cold outside\n\n[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]\nI simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nThe answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nYour welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)\nSo nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)\nMy sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)\nMy brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)\nMy maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)\nBut maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)\nI've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)\nSay, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)\nYou've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)\nBut don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)\nAt least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)\n\n[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]\nI really can't stay\n(Get over that cold out)\nBaby, it's cold\nBaby, it's cold outside\n\n"}
