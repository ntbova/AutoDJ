{"song": "Way Down Now", "artist": "World Party", "lyrics": "\n\nInside my TV eye\nNever stop to wonder why I'm\nWay down now\nI'm way down now\nSome faceless get on the screen\nThe most honest man I've ever seen\nI'm way down now\nI'm way down now\nWon't you show me something true today\nC'mon and show me anything but this\nShe took us by the hand\nHell was the promised land I'm\nWay down now I'm\nI'm way down now\nI'm lying by the road\nBecause she cut off all my clothes\nI'm way down now\nWay down now\nWon't you show me something true today\nC'mon and show me anything but this\nInside my future eye\nWhat I see just makes me cry\nI'm way down now\nI'm way down now\nThe clocks will all run backwards\nAll the sheep will have two heads\nAnd Thursday night and Friday\nWill be on Tuesday night instead\nAnd all lthe times will keep on changing\nAnd the movement will increase\nThere's something about the living babe\nThat sends me off my feet\nThere's breeding in the sewers\nAnd the rats are on their way\nThey're clouding up the images of perfect day\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnd I know I'm not alone\nAnything but this\nCan you hear me I said\nInside my TV eye\nI never stop to wonder why\nI'm way down now\nI'm way down now\nThen some faceless get comes on my screen\nThe most honest man I've ever seen\nI'm way down now\nI'm way down now\nSomething new! Something true!\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n"}
