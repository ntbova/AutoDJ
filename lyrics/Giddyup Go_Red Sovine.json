{"song": "Giddyup Go", "artist": "Red Sovine", "lyrics": "\n\nThe highways that wind and wander over mountain and valleys deserts and plains\nI guess I've drove about all of 'em\nCause for the past 25 years now the cab of a truck has been my home\nAnd it'd be kinda hard for me to settle down and not be on the go\nWhy I remember the first truck I drove\nI was so proud I could hardly wait to get home to show my wife and my little boy\nAnd my little boy was so excited like so when he saw his first snow\nHe wasn't old enough to say too many words\nHe just kept hollering goddyup go daddy giddyup go\nSo that's what I named the old truck Giddyup go\nOh things wasn't too bad of course I's gone a lot\nAnd after about six years I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone\nI couldn't find out what happened nobody seemed to know\nSo from that day on it's been me and old Giddyup go\nI've made a lot of friends at all the truck stops\nAnd some of 'em would kick me about my litle sign\nOf course they knew where I got the name\nCause I told 'em about that little boy of mine\nAnd how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup go\nToday I was barrelin' down old 66\nWhen up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig\nBoth stacks of blowin' black coal\nAnd as she pulled around and back in front of me a big lump came in my throat\nAnd my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold\nA little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup go\nWell I pushed old Giddyup go stayed right on him\nUntil the next truck stop where he'd pulled up\nI waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup\nWell we got to talkin' shop and I said\nNow did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go\nWell he said I got it from my pop\nDad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot\nYou see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen and I lost all track of pop\nMom said he got the name from me\nI shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see\nI took him out to the old truck\nAnd brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show\nAnd his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go\nOh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king\nAnd now we've just pulled back on old 66 and he's handled that big rig\nBetter than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen\nWell now the lines on the highway have got much brighter glow\nAs we go roarin' down the road and me starin' at a little sign that reads Giddyup go\n\n"}
