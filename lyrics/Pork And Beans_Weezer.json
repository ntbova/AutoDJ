{"song": "Pork And Beans", "artist": "Weezer", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair\nWorking out at the gym to fit my underwear\nOakley makes the shades that transform a tool\nYou'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool\n\n[Chorus]\nI'mma do the things that I wanna do\nI ain't got a thing to prove to you\nI'll eat my candy with the pork and beans\nExcuse my manners if I make a scene\nI ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like\nI'm fine and dandy with the me inside\nOne look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink\nI don't give a hoot about what you think\n\n[Verse 2]\nEveryone likes to dance to a happy song\nWith a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along\nTimbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts\nMaybe if I work with him, I can perfect the art\n\n[Chorus]\nI'mma do the things that I wanna do\nI ain't got a thing to prove to you\nI'll eat my candy with the pork and beans\nExcuse my manners if I make a scene\nI ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like\nI'm fine and dandy with the me inside\nOne look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink\nI don't give a hoot about what you think\n\n[Bridge]\nNo I don't care, I don't care\nI don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nI'mma do the things that I wanna do\nI ain't got a thing to prove to you\nI'll eat my candy with the pork and beans\nExcuse my manners if I make a scene\nI ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like\nI'm fine and dandy with the me inside\nOne look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink\nI don't give a hoot about what you think\n\n"}
