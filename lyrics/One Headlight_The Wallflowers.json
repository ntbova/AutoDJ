{"song": "One Headlight", "artist": "The Wallflowers", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo long ago, I don't remember when\nThat's when they say I lost my only friend\nBut since she died easy of a broken heart disease\nI listened through the cemetery trees\nI seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn\nThe long broken arm of human law\nNow it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face\nSo I wondered how she hung around this place\nHey\n\n[Hook]\nCome on, try a little\nNothing is forever\nThere's got to be something better than\nIn the middle\nBut me and Cindereller\nWe'll put it all together\nWe can drive it home\nWith one headlight\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said, \"It's cold, it feels like Independence Day\nAnd I can't break away from this parade\"\nBut there's got to be an opening somewhere, here in front of me\nThrough this maze of ugliness and greed\nAnd I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge\nSaying all there's good and nothingness is dead\nWe'll run until she's out of breath, she ran until there's nothing left\nShe hit the end, it's just her window ledge\nHey\n\n[Hook]\nCome on, try a little\nNothing is forever\nThere's got to be something better than\nIn the middle\nBut me and Cindereller\nWe put it all together\nWe can drive it home\nWith one headlight\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck\nI turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn\nWhat smells of cheap wine, cigarettes\nThis place is always such a mess\nSometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn\nI'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else\nMan, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same\nBut somewhere here in between the city walls of dying dreams\nI think her death, it must be killing me\nHey, hey, hey\n\n[Hook]\nCome on, try a little\nNothing is forever\nThere's got to be something better than\nIn the middle\nBut me and Cindereller\nWe put it all together\nWe can drive it home\nWith one headlight\n\n"}
