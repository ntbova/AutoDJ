{"song": "Love Me Down", "artist": "Freddie Jackson", "lyrics": "\n\nCome to me again\nIt's been too long since we had touched like this\nSo we jump right in\nIt's like caving it up again\nWhen I'm with you, baby\n\nI don't care if you got somebody else at home\nI don't care how might say\nThat it ain't right\nThis is our only change to be alone\n\nHoney, you can be\nHe's forever\nBut you gotta be mine tonight\n\nJust love me down\nFrom head to toe\nLet's cherish the moment\nAnd never let go\n\nJust love me down\nNice and slow\nWhen it's seems like it's over\nJust love me some more\nAnd some more and some more\nJust love me down\n\nFeelings never die\nYou excite me now more\nThan you ever did before\nWhat I kept inside is a passion\nI can't contain anymore\n\nI won't ask you to make me any promises\nThat I know in my heart you can't keep\nAll that I ask is that\nYou give me tonight\nWhat I always dream of\nWhen I go to sleep\n\nJust love me down\nFrom head to toe\nLet's cherish the moment\nAnd never let go\nNow just love me down\n\nNice and slow\nWhen it's seems like it's over\nJust love me some more\nAnd some more and some more\n\nOnly you can satisfy me\nBaby, say that you won't deny me\nLet's make tonight our very special one\n\nAnd now that we start this fire\nWe are slaves to our desire\nWe can't stop when we began\nNo, no, no, no\nOh\n\nJust love me down\nJust love me down\n\nJust love me down\nFrom head to toe\nLet's cherish the moment\nAnd never let go\n\nJust love me down\nNice and slow\nWhen it's seems like it's over\nJust love me some more\nAnd some more\n\n"}
