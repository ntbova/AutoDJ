{"song": "Ode To Billie Joe", "artist": "Bobbie Gentry", "lyrics": "\n\nIt was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day\nI was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay\nAnd at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat\nAnd mama hollered out the back door, \"y'all, remember to wipe your feet!\"\nAnd then she said, \"I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\nToday, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"\n\nAnd papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas\n\"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please\nThere's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow\"\nAnd mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow\nSeems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\nAnd brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe\nPut a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show\nAnd wasn't I talking to him after church last Sunday night?\n\"I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right\nI saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"\n\nAnd mama said to me, \"Child, what's happened to your appetite?\nI've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite\nThat nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today\nSaid he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way\nHe said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"\n\nA year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe\nAnd brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo\nThere was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring\nAnd now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\nAnd me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge\nAnd drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge\n\n"}
