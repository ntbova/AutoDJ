{"song": "High Cotton", "artist": "Alabama", "lyrics": "\n\nWe didn't know that times were lean\nRound our house the grass was green\nIt didn't seem like things were all that bad\nI bet we walked a thousand miles\nChoppin' cotton and pushin' plows\nAnd learnin' how to give it all we had\n\nAs life went on and years went by\nI saw the light in daddy's eyes\nAnd felt the love in mama's hands\nThey kept us warm and kept us fed\nTaught us how to look ahead\nNow lookin' back, I understand\n\nChorus:\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nThose fertile fields are never far away\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nLeavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced\n\nWhen Sunday mornings rolled around\nWe dressed up in hand-me downs\nJust in time to gather with the church\nSometimes I think how long it's been\nAnd how it impressed me then\nIt was the only day my daddy wouldn't work\n\nChorus:\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nThose fertile fields are never far away\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nLeavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced\n\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nThose fertile fields are never far away\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nLeavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced\n\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nThose fertile fields are never far away\n\nWe were walking in high cotton\nOld times there are not forgotten\nLeavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced\n\nWalkin' in high cotton\n\n"}
