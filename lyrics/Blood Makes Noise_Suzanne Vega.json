{"song": "Blood Makes Noise", "artist": "Suzanne Vega", "lyrics": "\n\nI'd like to help you doctor\nYes I really really would\nBut the din in my head\nIt's too much and it's no good\nI'm standing in a windy tunnel\nShouting through the roar\nAnd I'd like to give the information\nYou're asking for\n\nBut blood makes noise\nIt's a ringing in my ear\nBlood makes noise\nAnd I can't really hear you\nIn the thickening of fear\n\nI think that you might want to know\nThe details and the facts\nBut there's something in my blood\nDenies the memory of the acts\nSo just forget it Doc\nI think it's really cool that you're concerned\nBut we'll have to try again\nAfter the silence has returned\n\n'Cause blood makes noise\nIt's a ringing in my ear\nBlood makes noise\nAnd I can't really hear you\nIn the thickening of fear\n\n(Blood makes noise)\nBlood makes noise\n(Blood. Makes. Noise.)\nBlood makes noise\n\nBlood makes noise\n\n"}
