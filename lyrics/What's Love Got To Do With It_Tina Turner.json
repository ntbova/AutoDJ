{"song": "What's Love Got To Do With It", "artist": "Tina Turner", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou must understand though the touch of your hand\nMakes my pulse react\nThat it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl\nOpposites attract\nIt's physical\nOnly logical\nYou must try to ignore that it means more than that\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWhat's love but a second-hand emotion?\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt may seem to you that I'm acting confused\nWhen you're close to me\nIf I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace\nI've got cause to be\nThere's a name for it\nThere's a phrase that fits\nBut whatever the reason you do it for me\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWhat's love but a second-hand emotion?\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n[Bridge]\nI've been taking on a new direction\nBut I have to say\nI've been thinking about my own protection\nIt scares me to feel this way\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWhat's love but a second-hand emotion?\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWhat's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWhat's love but a second-hand emotion?\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n[Outro]\nWhat's love?\nGot to do it\nGot to do it\nWhat's love?\n\n"}
