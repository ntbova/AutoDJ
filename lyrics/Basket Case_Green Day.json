{"song": "Basket Case", "artist": "Green Day", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nDo you have the time to listen to me whine?\nAbout nothing and everything all at once\nI am one of those\nMelodramatic fools\nNeurotic to the bone\nNo doubt about it\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I give myself the creeps\nSometimes my mind plays tricks on me\nIt all keeps adding up\nI think I'm cracking up\nAm I just paranoid?\nOr am I just stoned?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went to a shrink\nTo analyze my dreams\nShe says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down\nI went to a whore\nHe said my life's a bore\nSo quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I give myself the creeps\nSometimes my mind plays tricks on me\nIt all keeps adding up\nI think I'm cracking up\nAm I just paranoid?\nI'm just stoned\n\n[Bridge]\nGrasping to control\nSo I better hold on\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I give myself the creeps\nSometimes my mind plays tricks on me\nIt all keeps adding up\nI think I'm cracking up\nAm I just paranoid?\nI'm just stoned\n\n"}
