{"song": "Killin' Time", "artist": "Clint Black", "lyrics": "\n\nYou were the first thing that I thought of\nWhen I thought I drank you off my mind\nWhen I get lost in the liquor\nYou're the only one I find\nAnd if I did the things I oughta\nYou still would not be mine\n\nSo I'll keep a tight grip on the bottle\nGettin' loose and killin' time\nThis killin' time is killin' me\nDrinking myself blind thinkin' I won't see\nThat if I cross that line and they bury me\nI just might find I'll be killin' time for eternity\n\nI don't know nothin' 'bout tomorrow\nI've been lost in yesterday\nI've spent all my life just dying For a love that passed away\nAnd if there's an end to all my sorrow\nAnd this is the only price I'll pay I'll be a happy man when I go\nAnd I can't wait another day\n\nRepeat chorus\n\n"}
