{"song": "Skip A Rope", "artist": "Henson Cargill", "lyrics": "\n\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nOh listen to the children while they play\nNow ain't it kind of funny what the children say?\nSkip a rope\n\nDaddy hates mommy, mommy hates dad\nLast night you should'a heard the fight they had\nIt gave little sister another bad dream\nShe woke us all up with a terrible scream\n\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nOh, listen to the children while they play\nNow ain't it kind of funny what the children say?\n\nSkip a rope\n\nCheat on your taxes, don't be a fool\nNow what was that they said about a golden rule?\nNever mind the rule, just play to win\nAnd hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin\n\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nOh, listen to the children while they play\nNow ain't it kind of funny what the children say?\nSkip a rope\n\nStab 'em in the back that's the name of the game\nAnd mommy, and daddy, are who's to blame\n\nSkip a rope, skip a rope\nJust listen to your children while they play\nIt's really, not, very funny, what the children say\nSkip a rope (4 x descending)\n\n"}
