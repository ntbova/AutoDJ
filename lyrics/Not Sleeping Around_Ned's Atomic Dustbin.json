{"song": "Not Sleeping Around", "artist": "Ned's Atomic Dustbin", "lyrics": "\n\nDon't know if I'm right\nBut I'm not wrong, just now\nDon't know what makes you think I'm so strong\nSomehow\nIt's in keeping\nWith my not sleeping around\n\nYou keep thinking I'm tired of you\nBut I'm just tired\nWhile I keep saying you're sick of me\nBut you're just sick\nIt's in keeping\nWith your not sleeping around\n\nYou only do it 'cause you can\nYou only say it 'cause you can\nI'm supposed to take it like a man\nWhat if I can't?\nI can't give more, you can't take more\n\nYou only do it 'cause you can\nYou only say it 'cause you can\nI'm supposed to take it like a man\nWhat if I can?\n\nI can't keep it from my head\nThat you're never around, never around\nYou can't get yourself out of bed, so\nYou never come 'round, you never come 'round\n\nIt gets too hard for me to think\nThat becomes too much to drink\nNow I'm scared that if I blink\nYou'll be on the brink\nOf needing a free roam, please don't let go\n\nDon't know if I'm right\nBut I'm not wrong, just now\nDon't know what makes you think I'm so strong\nSomehow\n\nIt's in keeping\nWith my not sleeping around\n\n"}
