{"song": "Flashdance...What A Feeling", "artist": "Irene Cara", "lyrics": "\n\nFirst when there's nothing\nBut a slow glowing dream\nThat your fear seems to hide\nDeep inside your mind\n\nAll alone, I have cried\nSilent tears full of pride\nIn a world made of steel\nMade of stone\n\nWell, I hear the music\nClose my eyes, feel the rhythm\nWrap around, take a hold of my heart\n\nWhat a feeling\nBeing's believing\nI can have it all\nNow I'm dancing for my life\n\nTake your passion\nAnd make it happen\nPictures come alive\nYou can dance right through your life\n\nNow I hear the music\nClose my eyes, I am rhythm\nIn a flash, it takes hold of my heart\n\nWhat a feeling, being's believing\nI can have it all\nNow I'm dancing for my life\n\nTake your passion\nAnd make it happen\nPictures come alive\nNow I'm dancing through my life\n\nWhat a feeling\n\nWhat a feeling (I am music now)\nBeing's believing (I am rhythm now)\nPictures come alive\nYou can dance right through your life\n\nWhat a feeling (I can really have it all)\nWhat a feeling\n(Pictures come alive when I call)\nI can have it all (I can really have it all)\n\nHave it all (pictures come alive when I call)\n(Call, call ,call, call, what a feeling)\nI can have it all (being's believing)\nBeing's believing (take your passion)\n(Make it happen) Make it happen\n(What a feeling) What a feeling\n\n"}
