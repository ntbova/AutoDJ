(C'mon now, do that stupid dance for me)\n\n[Interlude]\n(C'mon, c'mon, dance for me)\n(C'mon, c'mon, dance for me)\n(C'mon, c'mon, dance for me)\n\n[Chorus]\nOooh yea, you do what they tell you to\nYou say what they say\nYou try to be everything to everyone\nYea, you jump through the big hoop\nYou play all the right games\nYou try to be everything to everyone\n\n[Bridge/Outro]\nSpin around and fall down (do it again)\nYou stumble and you fall down (yea, why won't you ever learn?)\nSpin around and fall down (do it again)\nYou stumble and you fall\n\n"}
