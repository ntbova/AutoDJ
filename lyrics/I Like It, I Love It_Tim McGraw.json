{"song": "I Like It, I Love It", "artist": "Tim McGraw", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nSpent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair\nI threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear\nShe's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear\nI ain't seen the Braves play a game all year\nI'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep\nMy long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\nI try so hard, I can't rise above it\nDon't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'\nBut I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy\nBut it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me\nNow I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors\nI'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors\nI'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss\nPrayin' that it keeps goin' on like this\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\nI try so hard, I can't rise above it\nDon't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'\nBut I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\n\n[Bridge]\nGotta wash my truck and dress up\nTo pick her up to watch TV\nAnd she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer\nShe can't get enough of me\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\nI try so hard, I can't rise above it\nDon't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'\nBut I like it, I love it, I want some more of it\n\n[Outro]\nCome on, baby\nYou know what I like\nYeah, I like that\nMmm, mmm, mmm\nHey, don't forget to turn out the lights\n\n"}
