{"song": "The Christmas Waltz", "artist": "Frank Sinatra", "lyrics": "\n\nFrosted windowpanes\nCandles gleaming inside\nPainted candy canes on the tree\nSanta's on his way\nHe's filled his sleigh with things\nThings for you and me\n\nIt's that time of year\nWhen the world falls in love\nEv'ry song you hear seems to say\n\"Merry Christmas\nMay your New Year dreams come true\"\n\nAnd this song of mine\nIn three-quarter time\nWishes you and yours the same thing, too\n\n"}
