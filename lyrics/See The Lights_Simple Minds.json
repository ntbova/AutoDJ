{"song": "See The Lights", "artist": "Simple Minds", "lyrics": "\n\nSummer's gone winter's in your eyes\nI can feel the thunder storms inside\nI wake every morning and the cold winds cover me\nAll I've got's a ghost of what could be\nIf you can see the lights shine in front of me\nIf you can see the lights shout out where you'll be\n\nI'm in a broken dream I stare out into space\nYou know I called you up cos nothing takes your place\nI've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside\nI want to tell you love I'm too proud to cry\n\nIf you can see the lights shine in front of me\nIf you can see the lights shout out where you'll be\nSummer's gone and I can't tell you lies\nOh forgive me love I'm too proud to cry\n\nIf you can see the lights shine in front of me\nIf you can see the lights shout out where you'll be\nSummer's gone and I can't tell you lies\nForgive me love I'm too proud to cry\nToo proud to cry\n\nToo proud to cry\n\nToo proud to cry\n\n"}
