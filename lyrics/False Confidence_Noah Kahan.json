{"song": "False Confidence", "artist": "Noah Kahan", "lyrics": "\n\n[Verse 1]\nDon't take yourself so seriously\nLook at you all dressed up for someone you never see\nYou're here for a reason but you don't know why\nYou're split and uneven your hands to the sky\nSurrender yourself\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder why I tear myself down\nTo be built back up again\nOh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again\nAll that's left of myself\nHoles in my false confidence\nAnd now I lay myself down\nAnd hope I wake up young again\nHope I wake up young again\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't let those demons in again\nI fill the void up with polished doubt, fake sentiment\nSurrender yourself\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder why I tear myself down\nTo be built back up again\nOh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again\nAll that's left of myself\nHoles in my false confidence\nAnd now I lay myself down\nAnd hope I wake up young again\nHope I wake up young again\nHope I wake up young again\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy won't you take me seriously\nLook at me all fucked up over someone I'll never meet\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder why I tear myself down\nTo be built back up again\nOh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again\nAll that's left of myself\nHoles in my false confidence\nAnd now I lay myself down\nAnd hope I wake\n\nI wonder why I tear myself down\nTo be built back up again\nOh I hope some how I wake up young again\nAll that's left of myself\nHoles in my false confidence\nAnd now I lay myself down\nAnd hope I wake up young again\nHope I wake up young again\nHope I wake up young again\n\n"}
