love\nAnd it was all that you've given me\n\n[Bridge]\nI've realized the dream\nAnd I visualized\nThe love that came to be\nFeel so alive\nI'm so thankful that I've received\nThe answer that heaven has sent down to me\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou treated me kind\nSweet destiny\nAnd I'll be eternally grateful\nHolding you so close to me\nPrayed through the nights\nSo faithfully\nKnowing the one that I needed\nWould find me eventually\n\n[Chorus]\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you've given to me\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you turned out to
